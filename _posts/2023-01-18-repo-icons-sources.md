**TL;DR**

> Where to find some icons for repo avatars.

In my previous post [Repository icons attribution][] I discussed a bit
about my peeves of giving proper attribution to icons I use as *avatars*
in places like [Codeberg][] and [GitLab][].

The solution I've found so far is a bit... *sub-optimal*, in the sense
that I go looking for stuff that *does not require attribution*.
Sometimes it's my stuff, sometimes it's *public domain* and/or [CC0][]
stuff. (In my mind they're pretty much the same thing).

As an example, I'm using these sources:

- [OpenClipArt][], even though I preferred the older site *so much more*
- [OpenGameArt.org][] and in particular [Dungeon Crawl 32x32 tiles][], which seems indeed to be in the public
  domain according to [this][].

All in all, I still would prefer to give attribution even for public
domain stuff...
