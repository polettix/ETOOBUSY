**TL;DR**

> Where this blog meets some automation for daily publishing posts.

Publishing a post per day, for me, means preparing posts some days ahead
and then make them appear as days go. So... why not doing this
automatically?

The [busypub][] repository has a software towards this aim. As of this
post, it is capable of getting posts from a *private* repository (which
I personally keep in [GitLab][] and merges them into a *public*
repository (which is [in GitHub][] for [ETOOBUSY][]).

It can be deployed in a [dokku][] instance (which I did), together with
a few environment variables for accessing the different blog *faces*.
Tell me what you think!
