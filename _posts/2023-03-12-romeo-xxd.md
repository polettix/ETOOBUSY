**TL;DR**

> [Romeo][] includes a stripped-down version of [xxd][].

In [Fun with Romeo][] I introduced... [Romeo][], a little utility with a
pot-pourry of commands that can be packed together in a portable [bundle][].

Among other little utilities, I also included a very minimal subset of the
functionalities of [xxd][], a fantastic hex dumper that is distributed as an
ancillary program with the editor [Vim][].

I only use it in good ol' default mode, in *plain* mode and in *reverse
plain* mode. So, for good measure, the `xxd` sub-command of [Romeo][] only
supports options `-p`/`--plain` and `-r`/`--revert`; all other stuff (mainly
dealing with formatting) is intentionally left out to keep it very simple
and... because I never use(d) them!

A minimal set of examples:

```perl
$ printf abcABC | romeo xxd
0000000: 6162 6341 4243                           abcABC

$ printf abcABC | romeo xxd -p
616263414243

$ printf abcABC | romeo xxd -p | romeo xxd -rp
abcABC
```

It's meant as a low-level tool, hence it will treat all its input as a
stream of octets and there's no way of forcing an *encoding*. YMMV.

I hope you can have [Fun with Romeo][] too, stay save!
