**TL;DR**

I usually upload [Docker][] images produced with [dibs][] on the [Docker
Hub][] - after all, it's easy to use and it's the default one in [Docker][]
installations.

I recently discovered (well, maybe re-discovered) that projects in
[GitLab][] also get a registry to upload images. So, it seems the perfect
way to host a [dibs][] project and also the produced images.

By the way, installing [dibs][] is really, *really*, **really** easy: just
download the driver script described in [dibs 0.5.4][] and you are all set!
