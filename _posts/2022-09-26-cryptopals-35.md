**TL;DR**

> [Challenge 35][] in [Cryptopals][].

I know, I know. It says "implement" and I should implement it. But it
seems that we're able to *negotiate* an alternative value for $g$, and
the alternatives call for very *insecure* results that boil down to
settling to a specific and trivial value for the shared secret $s$.

So... well, it's basically the same code as the last time, only with a
different value of the not-so-secret $s$. Let's start with a little
recap about it:

$$
s = A ^ m \pmod p \\
s = (g ^ a) ^ m \pmod p \\
s = g ^ {a \cdot m} \pmod p \\
s = g ^ e \pmod p
$$

where $m$ is our *private key* as *man-in-the-middle* and $e = a \cdot m >
0$.

In case we manage to force $g = 1$, we end up with $s = 1$ because
elevating it to whatever non-zero power always yields itself:

$$
g = 1 \Rightarrow s = 1 ^ e \pmod p = 1
$$

When we trick the peer to accept $g = p$, instead, we're setting to a
zero value for $s$, because whatever the value of the two (non-zero)
private parts, the result will *surely* be divisible by $p$:

$$
g = p \Rightarrow s = p ^ e \pmod p = 0
$$

Last, when we trick the peer to accept $g = p - 1$, which is the same as
$g = -1 \pmod p$:

$$
g = p - 1 \Rightarrow s = -1 ^ e \pmod p
$$

that is:

$$
s = \begin{cases}
1, & \text{if $e$ is even} \\
p - 1, & \text{if $e$ is odd}
\end{cases}
$$

If we can *also* trick the peer into giving the public key first, we can
adjust our value of $m$ so that we end up with an even value for $e$ and
always use $s = 1$. Otherwise, we can just try both possible values to
see which of them allows us decripting the peer's message.

Stay safe *and secure*!
