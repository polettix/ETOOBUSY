**TL;DR**

> I saved a JSON file with [metadata][] about the [Friday board
> game][Friday].

I recently discovered the solo board game [Friday][], which seems quite
interesting.

The [official rules][] include explanations for most cards. Other data are
available from files in the [files at BoardGameGeek][] (e.g. the [Scott
Pilgrim retheme][]).

I saw that both the author and the publisher monitor the pages at
BoardGameGeek, and apparently did not ask for removing that information.
So... I decided to collect the [metadata][] in a JSON file. It might be a
fun project to implement the game's mechanics in the command-line, as a
sort-of retheme that will be interesting for command-line... enthusiasts.

As I understand, this should not be a violation of any sort, but to be on
the safe (and polite) side I'll anyway ask for permission to share the code,
if I'll go on with this.

Stay safe... and polite!
