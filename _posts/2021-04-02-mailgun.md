**TL;DR**

> A simple program to send notifications via email through [Mailgun][],
> leveraging the mighty [HTTP::Tiny][].

[Mailgun][] is a handy service for sending emails programmatically. This
little program allows sending... an email to a recipient.

[Local version here][].

It requires only a not-so-recent version of [Perl][], i.e. 5.14 or later
*with all CORE modules* (I'm looking at you, RedHat's `perl`); as such, it
does not leverage any of the modules available on [CPAN][] and it's readily
portable.

It stands on the shoulders of [HTTP::Tiny][], which is a really useful
module - thanks [AUTHORS][] and [CONTRIBUTORS][]!
