**TL;DR**

> I put [romail][] in [Codeberg][].

After writing some considerations and some untested code in [Parsing
emails][], it was about time to share something working: [romail][].

It's mostly unuseable unless you know what to do, but docs will arrive with
time. At the moment, it supports my first use case, i.e. extracting the list
of recipients:

```
$ romail recipients -i /path/to/this.eml -i /path/to/other.eml
```

Stay safe!
