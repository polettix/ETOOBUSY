# The questions

I guess that the laconic assertion about what workdays are put an end to
all questions: there's no holidays, vacations, or other fancy stuff.
Just plain weeks with 5 workdays each. *Right*?!?

I'd probably ask if we can stick to dates in the [Gregorian Calendar][]
but I won't wait for the answer and assume it's a yes.

# The solution


I already said that [Mohammad Sajid Anwar is amazing][] and this
challenge shows how kind he is: we can reuse a lot from the previous
week!

We can look at the year by taking into consideration three parts:

- the first week, considering it from the first day of the year up to
  and including the first Sunday;
- the last week, considering it from the last Monday up to the end of
  the year
- the rest of the year, which will by definition be composed by complete
  weeks only.

We will stick to the convention that Monday is 1 up to Sunday that is 7.
If the first day of the week is $m$, then the first week:

- will contain $n = 8 - m$ days, and
- will contain $max(0, n - 2)$ work days.

Not convinced about that weird $max(\cdot)$? The first week wil *always*
contain a Sunday, and possibly a Saturday, so whatever number of
workdays will always have to exclude these two days. When we calculate
$n - 2$, if we get a negative number then there are surely no workdays,
so we use $max(\cdot)$ to clamp the value to $0$. It's a math trick.

Similarly, the last week will have a number of days corresponding to the
number of the last day. In this case, though, it will always start from
Monday and increase with workdays up to a maximum of $5$. So, if the
number of days in the week is $k$, the number of workdays in that week
will be $min(k, 5)$, underlining that there's a cap to 5 workdays in the
week.

Last, the core of the year will have a number $d$ of says that is a
multiple of $7$. Out of them, exactly $5$ are workdays... so the
computation is easy: $\frac{7}{5}d$.

Enough talking, let's get to the [Raku][] code:

```raku
#!/usr/bin/env raku
use v6;

subset FullyGregorianYear of Int where * > 1582;
sub workdays (FullyGregorianYear $y) {
   my $bdow = Date.new($y, 1, 1).day-of-week;
   my $edow = Date.new($y, 12, 31).day-of-week;
   my $bdays = 8 - $bdow; # 1 - 7
   my $ydays = 365 + ($bdow == $edow ?? 0 !! 1) - $bdays - $edow;
   return max($bdays - 2, 0) + ($ydays / 7 * 5).Int + min($edow, 5);
}

sub MAIN (FullyGregorianYear $y = 2021) { workdays($y).put }
```

Time for [Perl][] now:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl
use v5.24;
use warnings;
use experimental 'signatures';
no warnings 'experimental::signatures';
use Time::Local 'timegm';
use List::Util qw< min max >;

sub dow ($y, $m, $d) { (gmtime(timegm(1, 1, 1, $d, --$m, $y)))[6] }
sub workdays ($y) {
   my $bdow = dow($y, 1, 1);
   my $edow = dow($y, 12, 31);
   my $bdays = 8 - $bdow; # 1 - 7
   my $ydays = 365 + ($bdow == $edow ? 0 : 1) - $bdays - $edow;
   return max($bdays - 2, 0) + ($ydays / 7 * 5) + min($edow, 5);
}

say workdays(shift // 2021);
```

I know, I know... I'm always translating stuff, but it works!!!
