**TL;DR**

> It seems that I didnt' write about [mobundle][].

After posting [csv2json][] some days ago, I received an email from a
reader asking about `MOBUNDLE`.

The reader sifted through the [bundled version][] of the program, which
is *sort-of fatpacked*, but not quite. In fact, it has stuff like this
at the beginning:

```

# __MOBUNDLE_INCLUSION__
BEGIN {
   my %file_for = (
# __MOBUNDLE_FILES__


# __MOBUNDLE_FILE__

      'Text/CSV_PP.pm' => <<'END_OF_FILE',
 package Text::CSV_PP;
...
```

So the reader asked... what gives? What's this *mobundle* thing?

I thought I has already written about it, maybe in a previous version of
the blog, but I don't seem to be able to find it. So here we go...
*maybe again*.

Before [fatpack][] was a thing, a lot of years ago, I needed that kind
of functionality to produce bundles. This started within the context of
producing self-installing executables for software I had to put in
difficult-to-reach places (you can read something about it in
[Parachuting Whatever][], from the old blog).

From [deployable][] I eventually decided to extract [mobundle][], which
serves a purpose quite totally overalapping with [fatpack][]. Alas, it
did not have the fortune and following of [fatpack][], so I started to
lean on the latter, mainly for maintenance reasons; every so often,
though, I still revert to it, because it works quite well for my use
cases.

I'd say that it implements the 80% of [fatpack][] that fulfils 99% of my
needs.

It has an `--autoscan` option to be lazy, but what I like most is the
possibility to tell it exactly what modules should be included. It might
seem counter-intuitive and also brittle, but in my case the modules that
I want to bundle are mainly my own (like [Template::Perlish][], or
[Log::Log4perl::Tiny][]) and I know beforehand what I need *exactly*.
So... no big deal.

When my program starts like this (note that empty line before the
non-CORE modules):

```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl
use v5.24;
use warnings;
use experimental 'signatures';
no warnings 'experimental::signatures';
use English '-no_match_vars';

use Log::Log4perl::Tiny;
use Template::Perlish;
...
```

I can use [mobundle][] and ask it to keep the first *paragraph* at the
beginning, then insert exactly the modules that I want, then keep the
rest of the program as is:

```
mobundle --head-from-paragraph \
    --module Template::Perlish \
    --module Log::Log4perl::Tiny \
    --output my-program.bundle.pl \
    my-program.pl
```

or, more concisely:

```
mobundle -Pm Template::Perlish -m Log::Log4perl::Tiny \
    -o my-program.bundle.pl my-program.pl
```

It comes with a manual page (which can be asked with `--man`) and some
`--help`... but no warranty nor applicability for a specific purpose!

Stay safe and bundled!
