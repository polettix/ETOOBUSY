**TL;DR**

From time to time I find it useful to generate [Sequence Diagrams][],
i.e. images like this:

![Sample SSD]({{ '/assets/images/sample-ssd.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Some time ago I used [sdedit][], a nice tool that has the **great**
advantage that the diagram is entered as *text* describing the different
interactions.

Lately I needed it, only to... not remember the name. So I asked the
mighty internet, and [PlantUML][] came out.

It's *really* nifty, gets the inputs as text too, and has a lot of
[examples for sequence diagrams][]. So I thought... better write a bit
about it, so that future me will have an easier time finding it again!
