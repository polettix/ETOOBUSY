**TL;DR**

> I recently played [Nim][].

I recently played [Nim][] with a friend, with the slight difference that
I know what the game was about and how to play it *perfectly*, if
possible (for me).

We soon settled in the *misére* alternative, which I *sort of* grasped
but did not fully master. In particular, I still have to figure out
exactly when it's the right time to switch strategy from the *straight*
to the *misére* version, but maybe it will only take a little time and
thinking. Let's hope.

Stay safe!
