**TL;DR**: [kasai][] is a prototypal game system that allows implementing
terminal games resembling handheld systems like [Game & Watch][] and the
like. If you're younger than 40 you probably don't know what I'm talking
about.

Being... differently young, I have fond memories of playing with
*handheld* games, mostly [Game & Watch][] by [Nintendo][]. I definitely
remember playing with [Fire][], [Mickey Mouse][] and [Popeye][], although
I probably also put my hands on other ones or competing products (e.g.
[schiacciapensieri][] by [Polistil][]).

It's some time I'm playing with the idea, and some code, to re-create that
kind of experience on the PC. This is the heart of my over-engineered
project [kasai][] (which should translate as *fire* from Japanese,
hopefully), which I would currently define as a *workable prototype*.

## Install and Run

You need some experience with Perl modules handling to install it; if you
have the correct expertiese, you should not have problems installing
modules from the provided `cpanfile`/`cpanfile.snapshot` files.
Otherwise... you'll probably have to wait.

The main script is of course `kasai`, make sure to include the path to the
installed libraries and to the `lib` directory, like this:

~~~~
$ cd games
$ perl -I ../lib -I ../local/lib/perl5 ../kasai
~~~~

I know, I know... there's a lot of additional smoothing work to do!

## Game?

As of now, there is only a *workable prototype* of a game resembling
[Fire][] in its gameplay.

All mechanics elements should be available, i.e. the bouncing, the scoring
and the counting of misses. The... *only* thing that makes it still
a prototype is that there is still not that amazing sequence of little
falling men as in the original game, I'll have to think of a way to
generate it in some intersting way.

## Over-engineered?

The game [Fire][] could have been implemented in much less code. I know
for sure, even though I don't really know if I would be able to. While
programming the system, I had in mind other games too and tried to make
things generic enough to easily add them.

One design goal is to possibly enable the definition of a new game only by
declaring its characteristics in a YAML file, without need for code. I'm
not 100% sure that this is the case, I'll see in the coming weeks when
I'll try to define more games.

## Games Definitions

Each game is defined by two files:

- a *game file* with the generic and abstract mechanisms of the game,
  independent of how the game will be rendered

- a user-interface definition which maps generic and abstracts elements of
  the game onto something that is displayed to the player. At the moment
  only [Curses][] are supported, hence the only meaningful definitions for
  user-interfaces target the terminal.

Much more documentation will have to follow on how to write these game
files... I don't expect this project to be a success of any kind, but at
least I'll be able to add more games in the future if I have the right
docs!

## Any Feedback Is Appreciated

If you happen to give [kasai][] a try please let me know! I would prefer
constructive criticism, but even more blunt opinions will be welcome. Use

have a good time!
