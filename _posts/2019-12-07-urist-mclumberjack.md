I'm an enthusiast (although totally newbie) player of [Dwarf
Fortress][df] and, as such, I usually adverse anything elves might be
saying about trees.  Especially when they insist that we stop cutting
trees!

Anyway, even dwarves in Dwarf Fortress realize that if you want to cut
trees you must have trees in the first place! This is why Urist
McLumberjack decided to donate a tiny sum to help the [#teamtrees][tt]
initiative:

![Urist McLumberjack]({{ '/assets/images/2019-12-07-UristMcLumberjack.png' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})

![Urist McLumberjack donation]({{ '/assets/images/2019-12-07-UristMcLumberjack-donation.png' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})

Goodbye everybody!
