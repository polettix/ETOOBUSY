**TL;DR**

> I asked a question out of lazyness, could have used the web instead.

Today I answered a comment about a previous post on [Bézier curves][]
and I asked for pointers on an alternative representation for arcs of
ellipses that the commenter [Dmitry Karasik][] was talking about.

It turns out that the comment itself contained a little trail for more
investigation and I eventually found the paper: [ONE METHOD FOR
REPRESENTING AN ARC OF ELLIPSE BY A NURBS CURVE][article], by Emiliyan
Petkov and Liuben Cekov.

I also saved a [local copy][] just to be on the safe side.

Material for reading!
