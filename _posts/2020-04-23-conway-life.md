**TL;DR**

> Where I give homage to [John Horton Conway][].

On April 11, 2020 [John Horton Conway][] the Great passed away due to
complications from [Covid-19][] ("*Coronavirus*"). Alas, I only
discovered it yesterday.

Although he had a *peculiar* relation with his famous [Game of Life][] (e.g.
see [this video][conway-life]), I thought it nice to pay homage to the genius
with this humble contribution.

The code is available in repository [conway-life][repo], here is a
sample run:
