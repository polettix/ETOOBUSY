**TL;DR**

Since I started playing with a few SSH/PGP keys recently, it became
apparent that the private keys need to be properly backed up, or
everything is at risk of loss.

One approach that I've seen around is to *print* the keys, because paper
and ink can have good preservation capabilities (as long as you protect
them properly), are mostly immune to cosmic rays and best of all are
*disconnected*.

My search skills might have fallen recently, though. The only thing that
I've found around is [Paperkey][], which seems like a drag to use in
its original form because it would then require to type *a lot* of stuff
to restore the key.

The page itself suggests to use QR codes and provides a couple examples,
BUT (you saw it coming) it can rapidly hit the limits of encoding of a
*single* QR code, forcing to use a Low value for redundancy. To be
honest, this seems sub-optimal, because we're talking backup here and I
want the High value of redundancy.

So I played a bit with the program [qrencode][] (in a [Try with
Docker][] way) and... I don't know. There seems to be an option to
trigger the automatic splitting of files that are bigger than the
maximum size, it produces files, they seem like good ones but... I can't
read them back. So it's proved a dead end as well.

At the end of the day, I'm thinking about doing something myself. One
alternative is to use the shell and leverage command-line tools, on the
other to do proper [Perl][] programming, which I'll probably choose.

Stay tuned!
