**TL;DR**

> [Gitolite][] is a neat project.

So there's a group of an unspecified number of developers who would like
to start tracking code in a place that is also "central" and properly
backed up.

A very wide need, which demonstrates that whatever people might say
about [Perl][] and its health, the very foundational notion that *there
is more than one way to do it* has taken over the whole dev world and is
well ingrained pretty much everywhere. Which is also the case... in this
case.

There are *Software as a Service* alternatives, of course, like
[GitHub][], [GitLab][], [BitBucket][] and the like. They do tick a lot
of the checks, have a widely generous free tier and allow to have
private stuff. As any free service, though, they owe you nothing and I
think there were plenty of past experiences where this turned into a
cold shower.

The paid alternative would be marginally better, of course, with support
and people to take care of the lifecycle. There is still the threat that
companies might go in a different direction and leave customers with a
burning matchstick in their hand.

A lot of differences comes from the features these platform give. If you
need them, then they definitely have a weight.

On the "on premises" side there is a wide range of alternatives.

There are those that provide some web interface, like the full suite
from [GitLab][] (which provides so much more than just [Git][]
repositories management), down to the *phylosophically aligned*
alternatives like [Gitea][] and [GitPrep][] (to name a few), or other
approaches like [Girocco][].

Then come solutions like [Gitosis][] (which I understand is somehow
unmaintened so far) and [Gitolite][], which is a very neat project.

As you might have guessed... I'm trying out [Gitolite][]. I hit a few
bumps so far when setting it up, but nothing blocking. In both cases, it
has to do with the recent wave of changing the default branch name to
something *neutral* like `main`.

The first problem was that the fresh [Git][] install I had in the
prototype "server" (well, it is actually a
**COUGH**[Kubernetes][]**COUGH**[Pod][]**COUGH**) insisted on setting up
a name for the default branch. So I did set it to `main`, and *then* run
the setup for [Gitolite][]. Which meant that the administration
repository `gitolite-admin` got a default branch named `main`. Which
meant [it didn't work][].

The second issue has to do with having users set their own default
branch name and this being at odds with what the server thinks it should
be. [This has been discussed too][discussion], but it seems that there's
no solution out of the box.

All in all, these are ... *opportunities* to look into! So we'll
experiment with [Gitolite][], and probably settle with it for some time,
until we feel the need to step things up.

Stay safe!
