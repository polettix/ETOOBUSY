**TL;DR**

> A little utility to merge PDF files, with [Perl][].

So I needed to merge a few PDF files into a single one. And I *knew*
that I already wrote about it, only in a galaxy very far far away...
that has disappeared in the meanwhile.

Or has it?

Thanks to the [Wayback Machine][], I could actually access a useful
snapshot of the glorious `perl.it` and find a blog post from 2007 [Unire
file PDF][] ("Join PDF files"). Here's the program, leveraging module
[PDF::Reuse][]:

<script src="https://gitlab.com/polettix/notechs/-/snippets/2021606.js"></script>

As noted in the comments of the post from 2007, this can also be
implemented through Ghostscript (if available), like this:

<script src="https://gitlab.com/polettix/notechs/-/snippets/2021616.js"></script>

Now don't trust me, try yourself!

<script id="asciicast-363200" src="https://asciinema.org/a/363200.js" async></script>

It tends to produce slightly bloated files, while the Ghostscript-based
solution is more efficient space-wise... use whatever you find better
and applicable!
