**TL;DR**

> Using ESC in the [Curses::UI data viewer][].

The [Curses::UI data viewer][] has three main sections:

- the top one allows running a command that is supposed to print out
  JSON-encoded data (an array of objects or an object);
- the middle area allows selecting stuff inside the data itself, to be
  shown in...
- the bottom area contains the YAML dump of the selected part of the
  data.

It's possible to focus on the three sections. When the program starts,
it's automatically set in the top entry because there's no data to show
(yet).

When there is something to show, the main area is the middle one, to
allow selecting the right part. It's possible to go back to the command
area with `:`, as well as move to the bottom text viewer with `.`.

To go back to the middle area, I wanted to use the ESC button, because
it's so [Vim][]sy. Except for two bumps in the road:

- the [Curses][] distribution does not include a `KEY_ESC` constant for
  getting an ESC, and

- the [Curses][] distribution *uses* the escape octet to "generate" the
  keys.

In my installation, it turned out that with *some little patience* it's
possible to bind to the ESC by using its ASCII code `0x1B`:

```perl
$entry->set_binding(sub { $self->focus_selectors }, "\x1b");
...
$viewer->set_binding(sub { $self->focus_selectors }, KEY_ENTER, "\x1b");
```

The *patience* thing stems from the fact that hitting the ESC key puts
the [Curses][] library in a small hold time to see what comes next. If
nothing comes, the ESC key (`0x1B`) is emitted and the binding is
honored.

I've done a couple of tests and the delay is there but definitely OK,
especially considering that moving from the botton to the middle parts
can also be requested with the ENTER key, which does not suffer from the
delay.

Stay safe!
