**TL;DR**

> A little utility: [eml-gist][].

Sometimes I receive some emails that are suspiciuos, usually with
attachments. They got past the antispam etc. but still... better safe
than sorry.

So I tried to come up with a little utility to produce a *PDF gist* out
of an EML file. It is very crude but it should be fine to figure out
whether it's a valid email or just spam.

Find it here: [eml-gist][].

I hope it can be of help!
