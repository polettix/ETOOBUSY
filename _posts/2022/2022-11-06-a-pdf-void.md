**TL;DR**

> There seems to be a big void in [Perl][] PDF generation.

This, or my *search-fu* needs some refinement.

There's a few modules that I'd like to fill automatically and I thought
that *surely* there must be some solution using [Perl][] to this regard.

The answer is definitely yes but, to some extent, it is also somehow
*disappointing*.

There are a few *giant* modules (like *standing on the shoulders of the
giants*, I mean), namely [CAM::PDF][] and [PDF::Builder][] among others.
Hence, the area is definitely well guarded.

But it seems that when it comes to managing *PDF forms*, we can only
(easily) leverage on stuff built elsewhere and fill them in. This is
disappointing, because I was definitely expecting to be able and add
field stuff in PDF pages just like I'm able to add text fragments and
shapes.

The closer I've come is [this post on Perl Monks][postpm], which
*anyway* does not start from scratch and makes some assumptions about
the structure of a starting PDF:

Well, it's definitely *too difficult* for me.

So well, there we go: as of today, I haven't found a programmatic way
(in [Perl][], at least) to generate PDF forms from scratch.

Stay safe!
