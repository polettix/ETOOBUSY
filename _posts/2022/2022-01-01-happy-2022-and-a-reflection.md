**TL;DR**

> **Happy 2022**! Will I continue blogging daily?!?

At the beginning of 2020 I wanted to write more and I thought that
setting the habit of writing something daily would help me doing that.

Alas, 2020 was not an easy year for anyone, so I had two times where I
did not write anything. This meant that the counter was back to 1 on
June 20th and also that having a full "single integer" year would mean
writing daily for the whole 2021.

Now we're past that point and, as I'm writing this, it's still 2021 but
I already scheduled everything up to the end of the year, yay!

So now... should I go on?

I found it very beneficial to have a recurrent time-bound goal for
writing more. On the other hand, I sometimes suffered that doing stuff
daily might mean having a shorter scope (wider scope stuff was sometimes
addressed with *series of posts*).

I'd like to start writing also something that is not necessarily related
to the blogging activity, or at least that might be blogged about only
after working a good deal on it. For this reason, I'll probably adopt a
different discipline:

- continue to participate in [The Weekly Challenge][] and blog about it.
  It's been an invaluable source of inspiration (as well as of 2/7th of
  topics) and it's just fun to do it.
- Write something new at least every week. This might be either going
  forward with a "wider" project, OR writing a new blog post in lack of
  working on those projects.
- Continue to blog about interesting things as they appear.
  
I hope this will keep me "active" because there will be the weekly goal
(beyond [The Weekly Challenge][]) to keep me in line. Otherwise... I'll
think about something different.
