**TL;DR**

> I looked into a few Linux live distributions.

About 20+ years ago I became interested into [Linux][] live
distributions, i.e. distributions distributed as CD/DVD images that I
could burn onto a medium (even a CD-RW) and boot from, to get a
[Linux][] system without the need to fiddle with the hard disk.

The idea intrigued me a lot, because it opened ways to "look in a
system" without touching it (forensic-like), as well as being able to
try out things without the need to install anything.

Then CD writers/readers went out of fashion, I don't know why exactly,
and this was lost. Sure, it's possible to boot from a USB key. Sure,
there are memories that can be set (mechanically) in read mode. Yet the
simple fact that you can't burn a closed CD, or even burn it at all with
a CD-ROM reader, is still a convincing reason security-wise.

Whatever.

Anyway.

I took a second look lately, and my first impressions are *mixed*. I
remember having had a good experience with [Puppy Linux][] at the time.
Now apparently it's become a *family* of distributions, and I might have
chosen *not-wisely* because I could boot it, play a little but could not
save it into a disk (in [VirtualBox][], anyway).

Then I moved on to [Slax][] and *that* was fun. There are clear
instructions about what to do for [customization][slax-custom] and
there's also a decent amount of fun in using it.

> A a minor nitpick... it didn't save my `.bashrc`.

So there I was, with some nostaliga and yet too little time to look
further on. So... [Slax][] will be the one, for now!
