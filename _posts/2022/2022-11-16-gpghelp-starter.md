**TL;DR**

This is just an interim, it's incomplete (lots of placeholders), not
attractive and much *less*, but it's a starter: [gpghelp][].

Well yes, it's in Italian *for reasons*. I'm planning an English
translation *eventually*.

Everything will be revealed in due time, including the stuff to generate
it (I can be pretty much sure it will be used in this occasion only).

Stay safe!
