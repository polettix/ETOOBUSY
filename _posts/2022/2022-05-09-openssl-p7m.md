**TL;DR**

> [OpenSSL][] can extract documents from P7M files

I received a signed message in P7M format and wanted to extract the
contents - possibly from the command line. I initially thought that
GnuPG would get the job one, to no avail.

I [later discovered][] that there's an [OpenSSL][] incantation that does
it:

```
openssl smime -decrypt -verify -inform DER \
    -in $file_input_name -noverify -out $file_output_name
```

As it happens, we need to put **both** the initial `-verify` **and** the
later `-noverify` to skip verification and just save the data. I only
tried it on an input file with one single contained file inside, but
still it's a lot useful!

Stay safe folks!
