**TL;DR**

> I released a little program: [garq][].

And it's probably of little use, but whatever.

I noticed that the `google-authenticator` program that is installed in
many Linux distributions allows generating a new code and print the QR
code for onboarding into authenticator applications, but it does *not*
allow re-printing the QR code to add another at a later time.

This is not generally a problem, as most authenticator apps usually
allow for entering the secret code manually. But it's a hassle and we
have modules to generate the QR code... so why not?

<script id="asciicast-505454" src="https://asciinema.org/a/505454.js" async></script>

I know that the generated QR code... *can be improved* in the recording
above, but in my terminal it looks great anyway:

![garq snapshot]({{ '/assets/images/garq-snapshot.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Enjoy!
