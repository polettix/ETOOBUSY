**TL;DR**

> It's easy to run `sshd` as a regular user.

It's not wonder I'm looking at [Gitolite][] and I'm using the SSH part
of it. It seems the most straightforward to set up, at least for me,
involving no other software/configuration.

As it relies on SSH, it relies upon the presence of a SSH server, which
for me means relying upon [OpenSSH][].

It usually runs with `root` privileges, mostly because it needs to bind
to port 22 (which is below 1024, which means it's privileged). As I
don't like it, I've looked around to see how to avoid doing this.

Well, maybe the SSH alternative **does involve** other
software/configuration in the end ðŸ™„

I'd like to give credits to [SOLVED: Run SSHD as non-root user (without
sudo) in Linux][] for giving me the right hints. The suggestions work
well, as it is demonstrated by the fact that [gitolite-dibs][] produces
a container that is run as an unprivileged user without any specific
tweaking. Yay!

You're encouraged to read the tutorial, of course, as I want to give due
credits for the help I received. Anyway, the *TL;DR* is more or less the
following:

- arrange your own configuration file (e.g. [`sshd_config`][])
- make sure to bind to an unprivileged port (e.g. I use port `22022` in
  [`sshd_config`][])
- generate the appropriate *host keys* with `ssh-keygen` end point them
  from the configuration file
- set everything readable/writeable/possibly executable only by the
  owner and exclude everything else for anybody else (including group).

I hope it helps!
