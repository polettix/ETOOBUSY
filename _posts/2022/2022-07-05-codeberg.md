**TL;DR**

> I started using [Codeberg][].

As a regular ner**COUGH**geek, I'm always fascinated by the latest
addition in town. In this case it's a [Git][] hosting service named
[Codeberg][].

It is based on [Gitea][], a software that aims at providing the most
common functionalities in [GitHub][]/[GitLab][]. I mean, *the most
common for me*: hosting the code, keeping track of the issues, forking
and submitting pull requests.

Oh, and hosting [Pages][], too.

What sets [Codeberg][] apart from its more famous siblings is the
transparency model, as opposed to a *business model*. There simply is no
other business than to support software development:

> Codeberg, the community-driven non-profit software development
> platform.

Much more info [here][]. I hope that it will keep the spirit in the
years to come.

I don't have specific information that Microsoft, or [GitLab][], want to
exploit their user base. Surely enough, though, they are businesses
driven by business reasons, and try to compete providing additional
services that make them apart from the rest. I understand it, and
especially for Microsoft it's been a business model for decades and a
pretty successful one (as opposed to the business model of open source,
I mean).

On the other hand, I also think that it's right that there are
alternatives where what is available for free software is not
necessarily bound to the perceived alignment of the goals of free
software with the business opportunities of a few companies. I think
that Google did a service to the whole world in this, showing that
populare services might be shut down if they're not deemed worth the
business effort.

So... there will be stuff to read!
