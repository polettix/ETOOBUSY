**TL;DR**

> This is the 1000th post in this blog, yay!

So we're celebrating with a crappy image that took me *significantly
more* than the average time to write a post:

![ETOOBUSY 1000th post]({{ '/assets/images/etoobusy-1000.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

It's been a funny ride, and very instructive for me - being stimulated
to read topics and write down notes for my beloved *future me* ðŸ¤“

Stay safe folks!
