**TL;DR**

> A tiny, tiny shell utility.

Many (well, *most*) times I get a compilation error in my
[Perl][]/[Raku][] programs. You know, a syntax error here, a mistyped
variable name there...

Fact is that I don't have a very fancy command line prompt, so it tends
to drown between an error message from a previous invocation and the
following one, making it hard to see where the latest errors are.

My very basic solution to this is to hit the RETURN key a few times, so
that I can see where the "hole" is. Until some time ago, when I decided
it was enough and thought of this very basic solution, installed as
`~/bin/newlines`:

```shell
#!/bin/sh
printf '\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
exec "$@"
```

It just expects to be pre-pended to whatever command line I have to
type: it will print the newlines within the first command (if it's a
pipeline) and then hand it completely over to the command itself. So,
now, I can write:

```shell
newlines perl -c whatevah.pl
```

and get some handy newlines before my... *compilation errors*.

Stay safe!
