**TL;DR**

> [Challenge 32][] in [Cryptopals][].

The challenge is amazing:

>  Reduce the sleep in your `insecure_compare` until your previous
>  solution breaks. (Try 5ms to start.)
>
> Now break it again. 

My server has an endpoint to set a new delay, so we'll start at 10 ms:

```
$ curl -X PUT -d 10 http://localhost:3000/drag-delay
set DRAG_DELAY to '0.01' s
```

Let's see how it goes:

```

Some back-and-forth with dead ends, but they are easily sent to the back
and the *right path* is eventually chosen.

OK, let's move on to the suggested 5 ms. It will be a long ride, but
time-wise we have comparable results with respect to 10 ms, because
comparisons are faster and we can try more in a second:

```

It takes considerably more but it gets there in reasonable time anyway
(about 25 minutes in the run above). There's actually no *real* point
where the solution breaks --no alternative is rules out, so technically
speaking this solution is *correct*.

On the other hand, though, taking too much time would be as if it broke.
There are a couple things we might do in this case:

- we didn't really do any averaging, except for *good candidates* and
  only up to a certain point. It's not even averaging, but taking the
  minimum. So that's surely one way ahead to explore, with bigger
  repetition counts being justified by the quicker evaluation.
- We might want to do more precise measurements, e.g. by going to a
  lower level with C code.
- We might adopt a multi-level queuing approach in which an expansion
  updates all the way up to shorter codes, while still keeping them
  though. I'm not sure this would *really* help but it sort of might
  with avoiding expansions in depth of dead ends. I guess.


Stay safe *and secure*!
