**TL;DR**

> On with [TASK #2][] from [The Weekly Challenge][] [#180][].
> Enjoy!

# The challenge

> You are given list of numbers, `@n` and an integer `$i`.
>
> Write a script to trim the given list where element is `less than or
> equal to` the given integer.
>
> **Example 1**
>
>     Input: @n = (1,4,2,3,5) and $i = 3
>     Output: (4,5)
>
> **Example 2**
>
>     Input: @n = (9,0,6,2,3,8,5) and $i = 4
>     Output: (9,6,8,5)

# The questions

There seems to have been a bit of back and forth with this challenge, so
I will not pile stuff on. I'd stick to asking for any need of basic
validation etc. etc.

Oh, and maybe if it's OK to swap the two inputs, i.e. get `$i` first.

# The solution

This *trim* function seems like an inverted `grep`, so why not implement
it in these terms?

```perl
sub trim (&@) { my $cond = shift; grep { ! $cond->($_) } @_ }
```

This time we're using old-fashioned *prototypes*, letting us write
idiomatic cool and even readable stuff like this:

```perl
my @trimmed = trim { $_ <= $i } @n;
```

But hey, let's wrap this too into its own function `trim_le`, and we
obtain the following whole program:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl
use v5.24;
use warnings;

sub trim (&@) { my $cond = shift; grep { ! $cond->($_) } @_ }
sub trim_le ($@) { my $i = shift; trim { $_ <= $i } @_      }

my $i = shift // 3;
my @start = @ARGV ? @ARGV : (1, 4, 2, 3, 5);
my @trimmed = trim_le $i, @start;
{local $" = ','; say "(@trimmed)" }
```

[Raku][] goes pretty much along the same lines. I still have to get the
hang of the alternative form for `grep` and other functions to put the
operation *after* a colon and using the whatever. Whatever!

```raku
#!/usr/bin/env raku
use v6;

sub trim (&cond, *@items) { grep {! &cond($_) }, @items }
sub trim_le ($i, *@items) { trim {$_ <= $i}, @items }

sub MAIN ($i is copy = Nil, *@args) {
   ($i, @args) = 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 5 unless defined $i;
   my @trimmed = trim_le($i, @args);
   put '(' ~ @trimmed.join(',') ~ ')';
}
```

Stay safe folks!
