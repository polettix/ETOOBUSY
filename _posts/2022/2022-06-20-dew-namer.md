**TL;DR**

> [dew][] arrays can be indexed by name.

When looking at data with [dew][], if there's a top-level array the
first-level selector usually shows a list of integers (starting from 1,
I know I know...):

![default view of arrays]({{ '/assets/images/20220620-default.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

It's now possible to set a data selector (keys separated by dots, like
`foo.bar`, much like JSON path identifiers) with command-line `namer` or
directly inside the application, by pressing `CTRL-W` and typing the
selector:

![set namer]({{ '/assets/images/20220620-set-namer.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

This triggers the selection of the "name" to be used for each array
item, instead of the integer (which remains as a default value):

![different index names]({{ '/assets/images/20220620-indexed.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

This should enhance the user experience when using [dew][] to look at
many items, because it will be easier to switch between the ones of
interest instead of being forced to remember their integer identifiers.

I hope this can help someone beyond future me, but anyway... stay safe!
