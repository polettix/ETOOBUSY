**TL;DR**

> I hate designing (ugly) GUIs.

I'm working on a project for a friend and I've come to *that* part where
I have to conjure up a GUI.

It sucks in every possible way. I hate doing this, I'm totally
unprepared to do it, and whatever I'm doing is at best... *ugly*.

Whatever, I hope it will work anyway.

Just to make stuff a little interesting, I'm using [Alpine.js][]:

So far it seems that no major roadblocks appeared, so fingers crossed!

Stay safe everybody!
