**TL;DR**

> [Diceware][dw] is an interesting implementation of the principle

Implementing the hint in [xkcd 936][xkcd] is relatively straightforward:

- come up with a list of words
- come up with a way to extract words from them with uniform randomness.

If our list contains $N$ words, drawing $k$ words randomly means that
there are $N^k$ possible passphrases. In XKCD's example, the list is
comprised of $N = 2048$ words, but that's *hypothetical*.

It turns out that somebody took the time to write their own list, and
chose to put $6^5 = 7776$ different *words* inside (not all of them are
real words, but they are assumed to be easily remembered things).

Why *that* number? This has to do with the second thing we need to
implement the system, i.e. come out with random words for each choice.
In this case, if we roll 5 dice in sequence, we end up with 1 in 7776
possible values, each mapped onto one of those words. So if we do this
four times... we end up with four words.

Enter [Diceware][dw]. They suggest to generate *six* words, not four,
but this does not change the generation, just how strong the final
result will be (which should be part of a personal assessment of how
many bits of entropy we need in our case).

One interesting thing about the project is that it has been translated
into many languages. As an example, there is a [list suitable for
Italians][dwit].

I'm not too enthusiastic about the specific word list (including the
Italian one), because it contains too many numbers and strange sequences
of letters, so I'm a bit skeptical that many people I know will be happy
about them.

It seems that I'm in good company as the [EFF][] decided to generate [a
different list for Diceware][dweff]. Alas, this is an English-based list
and I can't see anything like that in Italian. Still a good start
though, especially for native English speakers (or for people who are
good with English-only passphrases).

Stay safe and use strong passwords/passphrases!
