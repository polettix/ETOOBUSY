**TL;DR**

> I'm not thrilled by Gitea Ltd.

A few days ago I stumbled into [this toot][] by [Gusted][]:

![Gusted leaving gitea as maintainer]({{ '/assets/images/toot-20221112.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

The link in the snapshot points to [Why I am taking a step back][gpost].

As I understand it, it's a textbook case of:

- starting a project under the FLOSS flag
- grow a big community to drive a lot of energies to the project's
  success and acquire critical mass brand recognition
- pull the rug and take the monetization path (expecially thanks to the
  brand recognition).

Just to disambiguate, I know that in recent times *rug pulling* refers
to theft of crypto money and there's been no such thing here (neither
theft nor crypto scams are involved). I just find that the image of
*pulling the rug under some people's feet* is a perfect metaphor for
what happened here. Or maybe an allegory.

There is an interesting comment in the announcement page that starts
with this sarcastic remark:

> Good luck with your new Red Hat !

I humbly dissent. Red Hat started their business around providing
professional support for a specific Linux distribution, but both Linux
and a lot of the tools kept their identity and were included in
different distributions as well.

Here we have a stated goal that *seems similar*, offering professional
support, instance hosting... you know, the full package.

The key difference here is that they're not adopting a different,
possibly related name (e.g. *The G-team*), they're taking the main
brand. It's like Red Hat decided to call their company *Linux Ltd.*.

So, well... my personal opinion is that the owner of the domain and of
the trademark were surely entitled to make this happen. My personal
opinion is also that this was a stab in the back of the community that
was critical to giving value to the domain and to the trademark.

I'm curious to see how this will affect [Codeberg][], honestly. I also
wonder how many successful FLOSS projects are in the same situation with
the same risk of rugpulling any time soon.

Cheers!
