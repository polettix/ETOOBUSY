**TL;DR**

> I discovered [/dev/full][].

Thanks to [this post][post] from [Su-Shee][], I discovered
[/dev/full][]:

> Writes to the `/dev/full` device will fail with an `ENOSPC` error.
> This can be used to test how a program handles disk-full errors.
>
> Reads from the `/dev/full` device will return  characters.
>
> Seeks on `/dev/full` will always succeed.

Additionally, according to the [Wikipedia page][]:

> \[`/dev/full`\] provides an infinite number of zero bytes to any
> process that reads from it (similar to `/dev/zero`).

So there you have it, another thing that might come handy one day for
testing stuff.

Thanks [Su-Shee][]!
