**TL;DR**

> I will experiment Shame Driven Development for [App::Easer][].

So I've come to a point where **I** need V2 of [App::Easer][] to be in
[CPAN][].

I mean, I could adopt some different ways (e.g. clone the repo, use a
local package, ...), but that would be... *wrong*.

So, while waiting to add more tests and refinement and better
documentation, I finally uploaded the first V2 rendition as a [trial
version][]. Let's cross fingers for tests and within a few days I'll
make it official.

Now I hope that the shame of having published this *thingie* will prod
me to advance more!

Stay safe everybody!
