**TL;DR**

> Shift-Tab is actually BackTab.

While struggling to get the focus *movements* right in a small
application written with [Curses::UI][], I stumbled upon the need to
bind a focusing action to the *Shift-Tab* input sequence.

It turns out that the [available constants][ac] are defined in
[Curses][] instead. Being a lazy man, I looked around and saw `KEY_HOME`
and `KEY_SHOME`, so the `S` must be *Shift*. Hey! There's a `KEY_STAB`
here! I found the solution!

Well... *not so fast*. As I found out [here][], indeed:

    KEY_HOME  Home key
    ...
    KEY_SHOME Shifted home key

**but** this `S` trick is not necessarily *universal*:

    KEY_STAB  Set tab

Uh-oh... OK, let's find out all the `TAB`-related entries:

    KEY_STAB  Set tab
    KEY_CTAB  Clear tab
    KEY_CATAB Clear all tabs
    ...
    KEY_BTAB  Back tab key

There we go! Our *Shift-Tab* is actually the last one, i.e. `KEY_BTAB`,
which indeed worked for my little focusing problem.

Stay safe and *not too* lazy!
