**TL;DR**

> I updated to a new release of [Crypt::LE][].

I'm using [Let's Encrypt][letsencrypt] to get free TLS certificates for my
website. No big deal.

Except that I was still using the previous version of the [ACME protocol][],
which is going for good by June. I actually like very much how the sunset is
being done - getting errors from now and then. I started receiving these
errors in my mailbox, and with plenty of time I've been finally able to take
a look at it.

Long story short, [Crypt::LE][] is capable of handling the latest protocol
version (i.e. [ACME v2][], a.k.a. [RFC 8555][ACME v2]), so after about 5
years I did the upgrade with a few hiccups (including the total
restructuring of the underlying data model for [dibs][] which happened in
the meantime ðŸ˜…).

If you're getting those nagging notifications... the new [Crypt::LE][] is
(so far!) highly suggested!
