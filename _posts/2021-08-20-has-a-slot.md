**TL;DR**

> It seems that [Corinna][] is getting ahead.

So today [I read this][thread]:

![Corinna update: after much discussion, the slot declaration keyword `has`has been renamed to `slot`.]({{ '/assets/images/ovid-on-corinna-slot.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

I guess it's good news that [Corinna][] is going ahead, even though this
has a bit of *not invented here* taste and the need to please someone
else. This is totally my guess, don't get me wrong, but [it seems that
I'm not alone][nxdm]:

![nxadm on slot]({{ '/assets/images/nxadm-on-slot.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

I'm not advocating for a different name or for going back to `has`. I
mean, practically speaking I prefer that this moves on with a *peculiar*
name more than that it stagnates with a better one. Call me pragmatic.

I still think `has` was superior though. In the typical OO discussion
where the merits of *is-a* are weighted against those of *has-a*, being
able to write:

```
class Foo is Bar {
    has $baz;
    ...
}
```

is **so** self-documenting. It is *literally* using the same language
that is meant to discuss the thing. Call me pragmatic, or thick maybe.

There were some good answers to my observation, although I don't buy
them. Despite having different underlying mechanisms with respect to the
corresponding `has` in [Moo][]/[Moose][] (and for good reasons!), most
of the times people don't care/talk about this and just want to use
meaningful terminology. Here we're talking about stuff in objects
holding state, and `has` makes a lot of sense **also** because it's been
used by those modules.

Different things should be named differently, but I would argue that
those things look different only when we look at them *very closely*.
Which is what the designer risks to do. Moreover, maybe `has` makes
*more* sense in [Corinna][] than it did in [Moo][]/[Moose][], who knows?
I don't see it as calling *dibs* on something, to be honest.

Anyway, it's been enough of a thought dumping.

The decision has been discussed and taken, and I hope it helps bringing
us closer to the goal. Keep up with the good work, I think you people
are doing great!
