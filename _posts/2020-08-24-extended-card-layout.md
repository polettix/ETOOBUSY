**TL;DR**

> After [A card layout][], I thought of improving it allocating the
> half-slot for carrying three *flags*.

And here it is:

![]({{ '/assets/images/card-layout-flags.svg' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

[Download it here][].

The small part is divided into three slots for *stuff*, spaced apart.
The rationale for dividing the space is to keep the width of the slots
to be $K$ times of the separators, just like the big picture:

![flags division]({{ '/assets/images/card-layout-flags-detail.svg' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

[Download it here]: {{ '/assets/images/card-layout-flags.svg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
[A card layout]: {{ '/2020/08/23/a-card-layout' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
