**TL;DR**

> A list of Italian words: [Nuovo vocabolario di base della lingua
> italiana][nvdb].

It's clear at this point that I'm intrigued by passphrases that can be
easily generated *and* remembered. For Italians. Hence, we need a list
of words to start with.

> I'm not new to looking for lists of words (e.g. [here][p1] and
> [here][p2]): they're fascinating and can be a lot helpful.

So I thought of finding out a source of words that would be as widely
accepted as possible, to ease the adoption. I mean, it would be correct
to include words like [alacre][] or [latore][], but would that be
acceptable for a wide audience?

It turns out that [Prof. Tullio De Mauro][demauro] did indeed collect
the most widely used words and that the list is available online as
[Nuovo vocabolario di base della lingua italiana][nvdb]. Isn't this
amazing?

This is, of course, just a starting point. Cheers!
