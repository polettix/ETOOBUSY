**TL;DR**

> [skfold][] is also available as a *fatpacked*, *standalone* version.
> You still need [Perl][] though!

In my [previous post about fatpack and `PERL5LIB`][ramblings] I
elaborated a bit about my troubles in using [fatpack][] out of the box.

I've solved my issue there... so now the [skfold][] program is available
in a [fatpack][]-ed version to: [skf][].

Now... you only need [Perl][] to run it. Stay tuned...
