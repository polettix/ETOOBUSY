**TL;DR**

> A tiny recap on playing board games online.

Since before the Covid-19 lockdown, I've been very interested into board
games online. Around 2018 I collected a few links, and I recently went
through the list again.

The top place is, by all means, [Board Game Arena][]. It was *already* big
at the time, now it's just *huge*. They have a free tier that allows playing
*every* game, with the twist that only premium players can *start* some of
the games.

I remember that at the time I *desperately* wanted to play [Carcassonne][]
and it was available there, although it was one of the premium ones and, as
I recall, very popular and tricky to enter.

Another terrific website at the time was [Boite a jeaux][]. I discovered
that it means "the game box" or something like this; it has a nice selection
of games, including the mithical [Agricola][]. It was probably the *first*
such website I discovered at the time, although I ended up *not* using it
very much, mostly because of *lack of TLS support*. I would have happily
spent some money to support the site, were TLS available at the time. It is
very, very sad that [it's going to shut down][].

Another *terrific* website is [Yucata.de][]. All games are available to
everyone for free and without advertising. I only played one game so far,
but the experience has been good and there's really everything that is
needed, although the web site style is a tad oldish. It's definitely worth
trying other games, many of which are not available elsewhere.

If you're into abstract and more "traditional" games, [BrainKing][] is a
good choice. It has a definitely *vintage* look and feel, but at the end of
the day it's functionaly and easy to use. The limit of 20 games at the same
time is not restricting in my opinion, because I never arrived to this
amount of tables *anywhere*, but your mileage may vary. An alternative web
site for this kind of games is [ItsYourTurn.com][]; another is
[GoldToken][], although the basic free membership comes with advertising
(although I understand it's very controlled). Last, if your *thing* is chess
and its variants, then [The Chess Variants Game Courier][] might be your
thing.

On the other hand, if you're into abstract and more *recent* games, you
might want to pay [MindSports][] a visit. I have to admit that I *never*
played anything there, but the selection seems interesting if you're into
that type of games.

On a class by itself is [Richard's Play-By-eMail Server][]. I remember
playing some games via email *a lot* of time ago; I see that they have a
[web alternative][] now.

Last, I'd like to mention [Mattle][], a website that seems kind of legally
borderline, although my understanding is that it's *ok*. It re-implements
the mechanics of some popular board games, with custom graphics and stating
very clearly that they are not associated with the games they're *inspired
to*. My understanding is that, in the U.S.A., game mechanics cannot be
copyrighted, so as long as you describe the rules in your own words and
provide your graphics, you should be good to go. And yet... let's just say
that [Seven Wonders Duel][] is a thing on [Board Game Arena][], as well as
[Splendor][], so you might want to get the *original* experience.

I think it's enought for this post, stay safe!
