**TL;DR**

> I've started a small utility for origami dice - [origalea][].

If you're read some of my previous posts, you probably know that I'm
fascinated by origami and automation. I'm also fond of board games, and
recently discovered that I can produce origami dice by folding six
squares of paper (you can a slightly bit more in [Trying Cairo in
Perl][]).

So it was just natural to arrive to [origalea][], whose name is a mix of
*orig*mi and *alea* (which is basic *dice* in Latin). You can move the
`a` from one to the other if you will.

As it is now, it's not a very user-friendly tool, although it's not
terribly difficult either. You will need a few tools, all of which are
super-easy to get:

- [teepee][] - which is yours truly tool for expanding templates that
  have some [Perl][] code inside;
- [cairosvg][] - which is only needed if you want PDF output (I guess
  you will want it for all practical purposes, but this is your call).
  It's easy to get it if you have [Docker][], just take a look at
  previous post on [graffer][].

You can get the *fatpacked* version of [teepee][] like this:

```shell
curl -LO https://github.com/polettix/teepee/raw/master/bundle/teepee
#   wget https://github.com/polettix/teepee/raw/master/bundle/teepee
chmod +x teepee
# sudo mv teepee /usr/local/bin
```

Uncomment the last line if you're allowed to put stuff in
`/usr/local/bin`, otherwise put it somewhere in your `PATH`.

Using [origalea][] is pretty straightforward:

```shell
origalea --pdf -o file1.pdf a.png b.png c.png > die.pdf
```

Just pass image names (as PNG files) and you're done. By the way, make
sure that the images are *already* squared, because there's no fancy
adpatation.

If you're wondering where you can get *a lot* of square images for your
custom origami dice... you can head on to [game-icons][] and find *a
lot* of them.

After you have printed and cut each square, you can follow these
[instructions for folding and assemblying][faa] your die/dice.

Happy dicing!
