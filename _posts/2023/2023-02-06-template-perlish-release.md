**TL;DR**

> I finally released the new [Template::Perlish][].

I admit it... I forgot to release the module after uploading the trial
release.

Which, in time, accumulated 412 PASSes over 130 different
configurations. [CPAN Testers][] are amazing.

How did I figure out? Easy... I needed the new functionality and it was
not there! At least I remembered that I had already added the
functionality!

Well, this is it for today... stay safe!
