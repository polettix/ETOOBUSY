**TL;DR**

... and I can't say I understand it.

It's a collection of programs/libraries to make using the terminal fun
and easy, although I still have to find a comprehensive description of
how these pieces are supposed to be used *comprehensively*.

Or even why they exist in their current form to begin with.

As an example:

Why does it include its own SSH service instead of building on the one
that's normally listening on port 22, like e.g. [Gitolite][]? I don't
know.

As I said... I'm taking a look!
