**TL;DR**

> Another tool for hobby-scale projects.

In [Software Tools for Hobby-Scale Projects][] we took a look at an
intetesting page related to... *software tools for hobby-scale
projects*.

As it happens, that page is showing some wear after a few years, and not
all those services are still up.

One such service is *REFL.ME* - it's supposed to be a mobile phone app,
but I can't find it in the "official channels".

So I thought that I *already* have an app that can channel some
notifications for me - the Telegram app.

The basic idea for implementing this notification system is the
following:

- we create a notification topic, e.g. `heads-up-folks`
- people interested into the notifications subscribe to the topic
- when a notification must be sent, a `POST` or a `GET` are sent to a
  specific URL, which takes care to forward the message to the
  subscribers.

Yes, this really is *Warm Water 2.0*!

Anyway, it takes very little to get up to speed:

1. Look for `@know_tee_bot`.
2. Create the topic with `/create heads-up-folks` --it should answer
   with `OK`.
3. Get the details about the newly created topic with command `/show
   heads-up-folks` --it should answer something like this:

```
Topic Â«heads-up-folksÂ» in tenant Â«defaultÂ» (subscribed):
- pub: https://know-tee.introm.it/publish/7a8a383191417312ebb6de8be3ed4468/heads-up-folks/af25aa74cef0a49e809b28b599c96dba
- sub: /join 7a8a383191417312ebb6de8be3ed4468 heads-up-folks e0f0338245a8ab221eabd4ecf97f0b78
```

That's it. As the creator of the topic, your Telegram account is
automatically subscribed to it. At this point, you can use the `pub` URI
to send notifications, and receive them through the Telegram client:

```shell
# url is set to the long "pub" url above
url='https://know-tee.introm.it/publish/.../heads-up-folks/...'

# GET
curl "$url?text=whatever+you+want"

# POST
curl "$url" --data-urlencode 'text=whatever you want'
```

In case you want others to be notified too, it's possible to give them
the `sub` part shown above. Copy-pasting the `/join ...` command above
should be sufficient.

You have been... *notified*!
