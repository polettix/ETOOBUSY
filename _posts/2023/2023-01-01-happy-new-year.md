**TL;DR**

> Another year passed...

... but this happens every year, right?

It's really 2023 as I'm writing, and I still have the feelings I had
about one year ago: maybe I should stop this daily thing and focus on
something "more".

I say "daily thing" because it's actually just publishing: more often
than not I prepare posts with a few days of anticipation, so I'm not
writing daily anyway.
                     
Still, there's this feeling of slightly rushing things; I know I can
take the topic and go deeper at any time later, but this does not really
happen so the whole ghing is starting to feel a bit *hollow*.

And yet, this daily appointment has done wonders to keep me in line and
*do something* on a very regular base. Which is why, I suspect, I'm
still here after one year, pondering to change the habit but
uneasy at doing it (as shown by the last full year).

We will see... for now, I wish everybody a happy 2023, followed by
happiers new years!
