**TL;DR**

> I'm having fun with the [Synacor Challenge][].

The [Synacor Challenge][]

> is a programming challenge, but you can use any language you like.

It has a lot of adjacencies with [Advent of Code][], starting from the
creator - which is the same (i.e. [Eric Wastl][]), and going on with the
fact that different people will (generally/potentially/hopefully) get
different versions of the challenge.

It starts at the [Synacor Challenge][], site, where you too can register
and download the package for taking part to the challenge.

We are supposed to go on a quest and collect 8 codes; the first is
trivially given in the starting package itself, the second takes little
effort... then there's the rest.

The first part is about implementing a *virtual machine* that can run an
*executable* provided in the package. Running that program will then
provide additional codes (at least from what I can say now).

At this moment I'm in the middle of it, with a working code to run the
program... we'll see.

Have fun!
