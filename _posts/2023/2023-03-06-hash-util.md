**TL;DR**

> [Hash::Util][] can be useful.

[Hash::Util][] is a [Perl][] CORE module that can come handy when
dealing with *configuration hashes*.

What I mean with *configuration hash* is that many times I collect
configurations in a hash, e.g. when parsing a function's options or when
reading the command-line arguments for a program.

Hashes are very powerful and flexible, which is both a good thing (as
they are easy to use) and a risky one. It's *risky* because accessing a
hash by key opens the way to *undetected typos*.

What I mean is that if I define a configuration *variable* like this:

```perl
my $config_foo = 42;
```

and later I try to use it, but I mistype the name:

```perl
if ($config_FOO < 10) { # ... nope, this variable does not exist!
```

the compiler will fail to comply and ask me to correct my error. On the
other hand, with hashes:

```perl
$config{foo} = 42;
...
if ($config{FOO} < 10) { # no loud complains
```

will *at most* produce a runtime warning about comparing an *undef*
value with an integer, which might go totally unnoticed.

It seems that the solution to this problem has been in CORE and right
under my nose since the dawn of my [Perl][] time, in the form of
[Hash::Util][]:

```perl
use Hash::Util qw< lock_keys >;

my %config;
$config{foo} = 42;
$config{bar} = 'whatever';
# ... populate with other key/value pairs as needed

lock_keys(%config);
```

From now on, `%config` is *locked*, so...

```perl
if ($config{FOO} < 10) { # ... runtime complain
```

It's something happening at runtime, but at least it does not go
unnoticed!

Often times I collect options in a *reference* to a hash, but
[Hash::Util][] has me covered too:

```perl
use Hash::Util qw< lock_ref_keys >;

my $config = { foo => 42, ... };
lock_ref_keys($config);
```

If we also want to *freeze* the values, turning them into *constants*,
it's possible to use `lock_hash` and `lock_hashref`.

Stay safe and *locked*!
