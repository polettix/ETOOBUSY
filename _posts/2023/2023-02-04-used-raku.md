**TL;DR**

> I used [Raku][] for a casual program.

Which, even by *future me* standards, should not be a big deal, as I
have *already* used [Raku][] a lot in the past year and a half, with two
[Advent of Code][]s and multiple [The Weekly Challenge][]s.

So... what's the difference here?

Well, I guess that more or less for the first time this was not because
I specifically wanted to use [Raku][], for learning etc., but just
because I had to solve a little problem and I figured... *why not*?

The problem itself was quite trivial: given a list of dates, find the
longest uninterrupted streak. Here's what I came up with, in an
admittedly *strongly accented* implementation:

```raku
#!/usr/bin/env raku
use v6;
sub MAIN {
   my @dates = $*IN.lines;
   my $start = my $previous = Date.new(@dates.shift);
   my $n = 1;
   for @dates -> $datestr {
      my $current = Date.new($datestr);
      if $current - $previous > 1 {
         $n = 1;
         $start = $current;
      }
      else {
         ++$n;
      }
      $previous = $current;
   }
   $start.put;
   $n.put;
}
```

I hope you too have `-Ofun` using [Raku][]!
