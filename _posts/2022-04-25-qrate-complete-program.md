**TL;DR**

> The complete program for QRate... although still provisional.

The full program so far is available here:

<script src="https://gitlab.com/polettix/notechs/-/snippets/2296085.js"></script>

Due to the several modules involved, I want to produce a proper
[Docker][] image and place it in a project on either GitLab or GitHub.
We'll see!

Thank you for your patience and stay safe!
