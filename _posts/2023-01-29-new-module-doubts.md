**TL;DR**

> I'm thinking of releasing a new module.

I coded a new module [AstEval][] but I'm doubtful about releasing it on
[CPAN][].

On the one hand, sharing is caring... right? This would push me to
release it.

On the other hand, I'm not sure how much general is the problem that it
solves. It's basically an evaluation function for a very minimal
*Abstract Syntax Tree*, which I'm planning to use in a couple of
projects. It may just be that I'm reinventing a wheel, badly.

So... for the time being it will be on its repo [AstEval][].

Cheers!
