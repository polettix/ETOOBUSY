**TL;DR**

> I discovered the YouTube channel [TechWorld with Nana][] and it's
> amazing!

Not really much more to say, I looked only at a few videos so far and I
think they are very good.

Topics (so far):

- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Jenkins
- JavaScript
- Ansible
- Prometheus Monitoring
- Terraform
- YAML

One nice advantage is that you can jump more detailed parts and
concentrate on the higher level ones if you only need an introduction to
a topic.

Highly suggested!
