This is a quick'n'dirty way of extracting all links (i.e. `href` attributes of `a` tags) and images (i.e. `src` attributes of `img` tags) out of a list of local files (interpreted as HTML) or URLs (dynamically downloaded). Leverages [Mojolicious][].

It's very bare-bones, e.g. it does not pre-pend a *base URL* in case of relative URLs. It should be a good starting point though.
