**TL;DR**

> Some discipline about coding starts forming...

... at the very last, I daresay. No breaking news, so just a little
reflection about the obvious.

As many others, I have an ample graveyard of project that were started and
just remained *there*. From time to time I might go back to them, and *of
course* it usually takes time to figure out what I did, because I often go
*code code code* and no tests or docs written.

I mean, it's my spare time, right?

Well, wrong. There's always frustration when I cannot get in the mood for
restarting some activity on a half-dead project, just because the learning
curve is too steep *because of me*.

So well, yeah... [Tantalizing TTD][] and [Writing Documentation][] to the
rescue, but they're *tools* that I myself have to use to make my future self
happier. Nothing different from learning some *discipline* when you're
young; they might tell you that breaking the rules is how stuff really go
ahead and all, but you still need to stay focused on that particular rules
breaking that you're after.

Also, as I had to experience lately, the basic, fundamental importance of
documentation and proper testing/monitoring are not something that is part
of a common set of assumptions around. Yes, I mean *professional* settings.
Yes, I mean *professional* in the sense of what you do for a living, not in
the sense that you do it *the right way* because you know what you should be
doing. It was both appalling and a good reality check to avoid giving
*anything* as assumed. Yet... *meh*.

OK, the last paragraph was probably a bit obscure, but future me will
hopefully remember and understand what I wanted'share.

Stay safe and have a great weekend!
