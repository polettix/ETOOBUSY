**TL;DR**

> Documenting stuff before rushing to code

In recent post [Coding (eventual) inconsistency][] I ranted against myself
for leaving stuff in mid-air and not in a state where it would have been
easier to restart working.

Well, I guess the solution is do what I should have done from the beginning:
starting *writing* my ideas and strategy in a (small) document, instead of
rushing to code. So well, I'm not advocating for a three-months-long design
phase full of diagrams and whatever, because I can keep the *ceremony
level* at a lower level; still, it's useful to document what passed in my
mind in a less formal way, which might also give me a second view from my...
future self, who might spot gray areas and pitfalls.

I guess this means that a `DESIGN.md` document should become the rule! I'll
start with the little solitary game as a pilot project.

Stay safe!
