**TL;DR**

> Just a very, very short note to remind me what [Aspen Mesh][] is.

Some days ago I stumbled upon [Aspen Mesh][] and just wanted to write down a
quick note on it:

> Aspen Mesh provides a simpler and more powerful distribution of Istio

As I understand it, it's basically some company that decided to provide a
pre-packaged and commercially supported distribution of the open source
[Istio][] project:

> A fully supported, tested and hardened distribution of Istio that makes it
> viable to operate service mesh in the enterprise.

Enough for now, I'll hopefully add more about the service mesh as I learn
more about it ðŸ˜…
