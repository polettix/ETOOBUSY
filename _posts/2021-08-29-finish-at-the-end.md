**TL;DR**

> Use `=finish` in [Raku][], instead of [Perl][]'s `__END__`.

Sometimes it takes a long journey to learn something that was right
there, where it makes sense.

I often use `__END__` in my [Perl][] programs to quickly cut out stuff
from one point of the file up to the end. So I tried to put it in a
[Raku][] program and **saw** this:

```
$ raku prova03.raku
===SORRY!=== Error while compiling /home/poletti/devel/rakudo/prova03.raku
Unsupported use of __END__ as end of code.  Blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah.
at /home/poletti/devel/rakudo/prova03.raku:6
------> __END__‚èè<EOL>
```

Argh, a difference from the past. OK, let's ask the mighty internet.

Which, unfortunately, does not really help. I mean, there are questions
about how to replace `__DATA__` for putting... *data*, but nothing
really about using `__END__` they way I do.

More searching led me [to this][], though:

```
token term:sym<p5end> {
    << __END__ >>
    <.obs('__END__ as end of code',
      'the =finish pod marker and $=finish to read')>
}
```

So **this** is the solution: `=finish`!

```
$ raku prova03.raku 2>&1
===SORRY!=== Error while compiling /home/poletti/devel/rakudo/prova03.raku
Unsupported use of __END__ as end of code.  In Raku please use: the
=finish pod marker and $=finish to read.

**Today I Learned**: don't skim [Raku][] error messages, *read them*!

And with this, I hope you too will read those error messages and avoid
falling in the same trap. Until the next time... stay safe!
