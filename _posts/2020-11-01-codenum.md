**TL;DR**

From time to time, I show snippets of code that carry some numbering, so
that it's then easier to point out different operations in different
lines:

```
 1  sub get_some_sub {
 2      my $x = 0;
 3      return sub { ++$x };
 4  }
 5
 6  my $some_sub = get_some_sub();
 7  my $some_other_sub = get_some_sub();
```

Adding those numbers proved to have an interface I wasn't really fond
of:

- first of all, empty lines (i.e. lines with only spaces, or just empty)
  are not numbered by default by the otherwise excellent `nl`. This
  requires the addition of a `-ba` options, which I will probably
  **never** remember;
- then, `nl` just puts too many spaces before the numbers, for sake of
  indentation. I mean, they're too many for my code snippets/examples,
  which should reasonably remain below 50 lines;
- last, I usually want to add numbers so that I can put the result in
  the blog post, so I need that text to be put in the clipboard.

Considering that my *Vim*-fu is pretty weak, I resorted to a small
script:

```shell
#!/bin/sh
nl -ba | sed 's/\t/ /;s/^    //' | xclip -sel clip
```

I know, [xclip][] is probably something a bit too *Linuxey*, but I guess
you can figure out how to substitute it with your
command-line-to-clipboard feeder of choice ðŸ˜‡
