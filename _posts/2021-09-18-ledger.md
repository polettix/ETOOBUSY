**TL;DR**

> I discovered [Ledger][] and its siblings.

I'm thinking about releasing a new module `Accounting::Kitty` for
managing a split account (e.g. when going in vacation, or for more long
term agreements) and I think just by chance I stumbled upon [Ledger][]:

Well, my module is exactly aimed at managing double-entry accounting, so
it's definitely in the same sport. I don't think they're in the same
*ballpark* though, because [Ledger][] seems both much more refined and
ample in scope, while at the same time being quite more general.

One difference that struck me (although I was already doubtful about it)
is the difference in the recording format. While I'm requiring an
underlying SQL server that can be managed through [DBIx::Class][],
[Ledger][]'s basic storage format is plain text files. This is surely
easier for managing stuff by hand, but I think it leaves a problem on
the table when there is some need to provide multiple accesses, e.g. by
putting a web service in front of it. Anyway, I'm envious of the data
format because plain text is fantastic.

Another aspect that makes me envious is how transactions are modeled,
which is somehow a consequence of the simpler data storage approach.
While every transaction in `Accounting::Kitty` is always from a single
account to another single account, transactions in [Ledger][] can
include multiple participants at once. I had to explicitly *account*
(pun intended) for this by allowing transactions to be put in a
hierarchy, which e.g. is what happens when an expense is split across
multiple participants.

All in all, I find [Ledger][] an interesting software, so if you're
looking for something to harness your finances and you like the command
line... definitely take a look at it!
