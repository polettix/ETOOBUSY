**TL;DR**

> [TDD][] is a brilliant concept, but a bit out of reach for me.

As anybody reading just a few posts here knows, I'm totally not a
professional [Perl][] programmer. I mean, *literally*: I'm not paid to
code, in [Perl][] or any other language. I do this mainly for fun, which
occasionally can be an advantage for my work.

[Test-Driven Development][TDD] always fascinated me, because it seems
the right thing to do and, let's be honest, it can helps a lot building
interfaces that do not *suck*. Well, not too much at least.

Even so, time and again I find myself writing the code first, the tests
afterwards. *Almost. Any. Given. Time.*

To me, it's just like being [Tantalus][], which would like to eat and
drink, but cannot.

It's not even that I don't like writing tests. This morning I wrote
[some tests for Data::Resolver][tests] and I had both fun and
satisfaction (I even spotted a bug and corrected it).

So well yeah, maybe my goals for 2023 should include doing more stuff
the [TDD][] way.

Stay safe!
