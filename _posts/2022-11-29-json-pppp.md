**TL;DR**

> Something I reimplement over and over.

You might say: use a module, Fluke! You're probably right.

Although... we're talking [JSON::PP][] here, which is in CORE since
*some* time now:

```
JSON::PP was first released with perl v5.13.9
```

So... using a module tastes like betrayal.

Anyway.

I like readable and consistent JSON output, so here's what I often go
for:

```perl
use JSON::PP 'decode_json'; # no encode_json
sub encode_json {
    state $encoder = JSON::PP->new->utf8->canonical->pretty;
    return $encoder->encode($_[0]);
}
```

Trial run:

```perl
say encode_json({c => [1..3], a => 3});
# {
#    "a" : 3,
#    "c" : [
#       1,
#       2,
#       3
#    ]
# }
```

Function `encode_json` above serves as a drop-in replacement for the
same-named function that *might be* but *is not* imported while `use`ing
the module here.

Option `canonical` tells the encoder to sort keys in objects/hashes,
while `pretty` gets us some nicely indented output.

So there you go, a nice JSON pretty-printer in CORE!
