**TL;DR**

Some time ago I contributed a few images to [Pixabay][]. I really liked
the idea of a central site with quality images in the Public Domain,
through a [CC0][] license.

Alas, this seems to not be the case any more. Licenses for my images
have been turned to their own license, which is not how I meant sharing
my work.

Hence, those few photos are now available - back to [CC0][] - in a
little website leveraging [GitLab][] [Pages][]: [CC0 Images!][]

Enjoy and... it's all for today!
