**TL;DR**

# The challenge

> You are given a list of sentences, @list.
>
>> A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with
>> no leading or trailing spaces.
>
> Write a script to find out the maximum number of words that appear in a

>     Input: @list = ("Perl and Raku belong to the same family.",

# The questions

This is tricky, because there's so much that might go wrong.

One question is whether inputs should be checked to tell *sentences* out of
the input strings. I mean, one of the strings might start with a space: is
this possible, or should we just filter the string out? Same goes with
strings that might contain two spaces in a row, or newlines, etc.

We'll assume that no input checking (nor sanitization) is needed and every
input strings is a valid *sentence*.

# The solution

The algorithm is straightforward: turn each input string into a word count,
then take the maximum:

```raku
#!/usr/bin/env raku
use v6;
sub MAIN (*@sentences) { put @sentences».split(/\s+/)».elems.max }
```

[Perl][] goes by the same approach, although with different lower-level
plumbings:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl
use v5.24;
use List::Util 'max';
say max map { scalar(split m{\s+}mxs) } @ARGV;
```

I think we're done here, stay safe!
