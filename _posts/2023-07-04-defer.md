**TL;DR**

> Speaking of [Guard][], I almost forgot about [defer][].

In recent post [En guarde! Playing with Guard][] we took a look at
[Guard][], and I was almost forgetting about a *similar* functionality that
has been baked into our beloved [Perl][] interpreter: [defer][].

It more or less covers of the functionality of `scope_guard`, so depending
on the interpreter that you can count on it might go as a total replacement
if we don't need anything fancier (like the possibility to change our mind
at some later-yet-intermediate stage).

Transforming our first program from the previous post is straightforward,
keeping in mind that [defer][] takes a block of code (not a code reference):

```perl
#!/usr/bin/env wrapperl
use v5.38;
use warnings;
use experimental 'defer';

$|++;

scoped(shift // 'die');

sub scoped ($what) {
   defer { en_guarde() }
   if ($what eq 'die') {
      die "whatever!";
   }
   elsif ($what eq 'return') {
      say 'about to return...';
      return;
   }
   elsif ($what eq 'exit') {
      say 'exiting...';
      exit 1;
   }
   else {
      say 'dumpiiiing!';
      CORE::dump();
   }
}

sub en_guarde { warn "en_guarde(@_)!" }
```

The result is the same as the [Guard][] case:

```
$ ./defer-1.pl die
whatever! at ./defer-1.pl line 13.
en_guarde()! at ./defer-1.pl line 29.

$ ./defer-1.pl return
about to return...
en_guarde()! at ./defer-1.pl line 29.

$ ./defer-1.pl exit
exiting...
en_guarde()! at ./defer-1.pl line 29.

$ ./defer-1.pl dump
dumpiiiing!
Aborted
```

So well, I think that [Guard][] still makes *a lot* of sense until pre-5.36
interpreter will be *significantly around*, or sophisticated guards are
needed. Otherwise... you can [defer][] its installation!
