**TL;DR**

> On with [Advent of Code][] [puzzle 19][p19] from [2016][aoc2016]:
> [Josephus problem][]!

I know this is a *spoiler* in the very title of the post, but the [2016
edition][aoc2016] of [Advent of Code][] was... well... more than four
years ago!

Although described as an instance of [White Elephant parties][], the
author decided to give some spoiler too, because the title of the puzzle
is... *Day 19: An Elephant Named Joseph* ðŸ˜„

So... it seems that all that time spent on watching [Numberphile][]
videos was *indeed well spent*, because they covered this very topic
quite well: [The Josephus Problem - Numberphile][]. It's a very
interesting video!

The one interesting thing is that this problem has a closed-form
solution that's easy to code in $O(1)$. As a matter of fact, some bit
fiddling suffices here, here's my [Perl][] implementation for the first
part of the puzzle:

```perl
sub josephus ($n) {
   my $p2 = 0x1;
   $p2 = ($p2 << 1) | 0x1 while $p2 < $n;
   my $k = $n & ($p2 >> 1);
   return $k << 1 | 1;
}
```

The part that I'm not entirely happy with, to be honest, is the one
where I look for the right mask to get rid of the biggest power of $2$
in the number, because it's a loop and I should probably say that the
algorithm is actually $O(k)$ where $k$ is the number of bits
representing integers here. But... if we stick with 64 bit integers
we're still at $O(1)$, right?!?

I had fun with this puzzle because I remembered about the [Josephus
problem][] and I also remembered that there was some way to figure out
the rule. So I had the pleasure to re-derive it.

I know, it's easy to please me with these nerdy stuff ðŸ¤“
