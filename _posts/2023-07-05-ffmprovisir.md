**TL;DR**

> [ffmprovisir][] is an instant bookmark.

If you don't follow [Julia Evans][] ([@b0rk][], [wizard zines][]), up to
this moment your only excuse was that you didn't know about her and now you
can't say it any more.

This said, [this][] is how I discovered about [ffmprovisir][], one of those
neat ideas that keep making me feel stupid for *not* having had them before.
(*Lazy me* is extremely proud of his cleverness, though, so all in all we're
even).

Well, *of course* this also reminds me of [tldr][], right?
