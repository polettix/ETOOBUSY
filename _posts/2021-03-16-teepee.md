**TL;DR**

> Quick access to [teepee][].

There are a few tools that I coded that I use consistently, and one of them
is [teepee][]. I already [blogged about it][teepee-blog], [shared
it][teepee-gh] on [GitHub][] and all of that.

Why a post about it then?

Well, I was actually a bit *tired* of searching for it all the times, and
this quick blog doubles down as a way to keep notes so... ðŸ˜…

If you're curious on how to use it, I'd suggest looking at the blog post or
the dedicated pages linked above. If you just want to install the latest
version though... you can copy-paste the part relevant to you from this:

```shell
curl -LO https://github.com/polettix/teepee/raw/master/bundle/teepee
#   wget https://github.com/polettix/teepee/raw/master/bundle/teepee

chmod +x teepee

sudo mv teepee /usr/local/bin
```

> The bundled version (sort-of fat-packed) leverages on [YAML::Tiny][] which
> mostly does its job *but* unfortunately does not support anchors and
> references, which is hugely useful in some situations. Well... life sucks
> sometimes.

Stay safe folks!
