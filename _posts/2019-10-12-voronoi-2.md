In the [first article about my quest for Voronoi diagrams][voronoi-1] I
ranted a bit about how everybody around seems to be talking about
Fortune's algorithm without having bothered to read Steven Fortune's
paper from 1987 [A sweepline algorithm for Voronoi
diagrams][fortune-springer].

Fortune also implemented the algorithm described in the paper as a C
program. It does what's written on the can and more, so it's not exactly
straightforward to follow.

I'll put some notes below about what I understood of it... I hope they
can be useful. The code can be found in Fortune's homepage ([here a link
to the copy at the Internet Archive][sjf-archive-org]).

## Adherence To The Paper

The program is largely adherent to the paper, with some caveats:

- the priority queue $Q$ is implemented in a "split arrangement" where
  sites and vertices are kept separated (actually, only the latter ones
  end up in a real priority queue). This is an implementation trick
  that, to any extent, is totally equivalent to having a single queue;

- the sequence $L$ of $(r_1, c_1, r_2, ..., r_k)$ of regions and
  boundaries is implemented as a doubly-linked list of branches only,
  where branches carry around also information about their associated
  regions. From a representation point of view it's equivalent, but...

- the doubly-linked list for branches  *cannot* be used for a binary
  search of the "right" region, which somehow defies the complexity
  analysis, although Fortune also implements a hash-based indexing of
  the doubly-linked list that improves performance (I have no idea about
  the asymptotic complexity though).


## Data Structures

The data structures used in the implementation can be divided into two
main categories:

- basic `struct`s/types: `Point`, `Site`, `Edge`, `Halfedge`. These are
  defined inside `vdefs.h` (or `defs.h` in some implementations);
- more complex data structures, like the Priority Queue and the Edge
  List. Their definition/implementation is not found in a single place.

Some additional structures/types are also introduced to enhance memory
management, but they will not be discussed here.

### `Point`

The definition of type `Point` is as simple as it can get, just a place
to keep track of `x` and `y` coordinates:

~~~~
typedef struct tagPoint
    {
    float x ;
    float y ;
    } Point ;
~~~~


### `Site`

A `Site` is slightly more than a `Point`:

~~~~
typedef struct tagSite
    {
    Point coord ;
    int sitenbr ;
    int refcnt ;
    } Site ;
~~~~

One aspect is that `sitenbr` provides an *identity* to the specific
`Point coord`, like a label or a tag. The `refcnt` helps with memory
management and optimization, so it can be ignored from the sweeping line
algorithm's point of view.

The `Site` type is used to represent both real *sites* and also
*vertices*. While this choice might be considered *cheap* by today's
standards, especially when coming from higher abstraction level
languages, we have to keep in mind that this is C and using the same
type for entities that share a common fate (the extraction from the
Priority Queue can yield either a *site* or a *vertex*) is a solid
design decision. If anything, I would have probably called it something
like `Place` to avoid a name that leans too much on one side.


### `Edge`

An `Edge` represents a bisector line in the plane, with some strings
attached. With reference to the article, it represents a *boundary*
between two *sites*, i.e. $B_{pq}$ (if sites are p and q).

~~~~
typedef struct tagEdge
    {
    float a, b, c ;
    Site * ep[2] ;
    Site * reg[2] ;
    int edgenbr ;
    } Edge ;
~~~~

Floats `a`, `b` and `c` are coefficients for the line, according to the
following equation:

$$ a \cdot x + b \cdot y = c $$

When a new `Edge` is created by function `bisect` in `geometry.c`,
the parameters are normalized so that either `a` or `b` is forced to
`1`. In particular, more *vertical* lines have `a` set to `1`, while
more *horizontal* lines have `b` set to `1`, which is consistent with
fully vertical or horizontal where `b` and `a` would be `0`,
respectively.

The two-slots array of pointers to `Site` named `reg` holds pointers
towards the two *sites* that define the bisector. These are real sites,
in the algorithm sense: a bisector always cuts the plane in two halves,
each containing the points that are closer to one of the two sites. In
other terms, if $B_{pq}$ is the boundary in the article, `reg` holds
pointers to `Site` p and `Site` q.

When a new `Edge` is created in `bisect@geometry.c`, the "minor" site is
always put first and the "major" site second. This means that the first
slot contains the pointer to the site that is either at lower y
coordinate or, if the two sites have the same y coordinate, at lower x
coordinate. The definition of the following macros:

~~~~
#define le 0
#define re 1
~~~~

also assigns a semantic to these slots: the bottom site is considered to
be on the *left*, the other one on the *right*. This gives the `Edge` a
natural orientation that always goes from right to left.

Every `Edge` created by `bisect@geometry.c` has two sites in `reg`. On
the other hand, you might hit a *null* `Edge` that is actually a `NULL`
pointer, representing a line at infinity.

The two-slots array of pointers to `Site` named `ep`, on the other hand,
holds *optional* pointers to *vertices*. The optionality is given both
by intrinsic reasons (e.g. collinear sites give raise to parallel edges
with no vertices, and all edges at the boundary only have one *vertex*
as endpoint but go to infinity otherwise) or algorithm phase reasons
(e.g. a *vertex* has not been introduced yet).

Last, `edgenbr` provides a unique identity to the Edge, so that if the
same line arises again the two resulting edges can be distinguished.


### `Halfedge`

In the original article, each *edge* $B_{pq}$ (assuming p is "greater
than" q as per previous section) is divided into two pieces, namely
$C^-_{pq}$ (that lies left of p) and $C^+_{pq}$ (that lies right of p).
The `Halfedge` represents such parts.

~~~~
#define le 0
#define re 1

typedef struct tagHalfedge
    {
    struct tagHalfedge * ELleft ;
    struct tagHalfedge * ELright ;
    Edge * ELedge ;
    int ELrefcnt ;
    char ELpm ;
    Site * vertex ;
    float ystar ;
    struct tagHalfedge * PQnext ;
    } Halfedge ;
~~~~

This structure mixes in the same place facets that belong to different
operations and semantics.

The real representation of an edge's halves $C^-_{pq}$ and $C^+_{pq}$ is
in the following members:

- `ELedge` points to the edge/bisector that this `Halfedge` is part of.
  This might be a `NULL` pointer, in which case the `Halfedge`
  represents a part of a boundary at the infinite (ideally, the boundary
  between the bottomest site and a site at infinite). The ordering of
  the two `Site` pointers in `reg` inside `ELedge` allows understanding
  which is p (the one on the right/second slot) and which is q (the one
  on the left/first slot).
- `ELpm` indicates whether this is the *minus*/*left* (i.e. $C^-_{pq}$) or
  the *plus*/*right* (i.e. $C^+_{pq}$) part of the edge. It assumes values `le`
  (macro for `0`) for the *left* part and `re` (macro for `1`) for the
  *right* part.
- `vertex` is an optional pointer to a *vertex*, populated in case this
  `Halfedge` crosses a nearby pre-existing `Halfedge` at the time of its
  creation.
- `ystar` represents the y coordinate in the `*`-transformed space of
  the `vertex`, if any.

Other member have to do with the fact that `Halfedge` triples down as
the central structure for representing the Edges List and the Priority
Queue too. In particular:

- the Edge List is basically represented as a double-linked list, hence
  `ELleft` and `ELright` are pointers to the nearby `Halfedge`s;
- the Priority Queue contains also vertices, which are held in `vertex`,
  so `PQnext` is the next one.

Member `ELrefcnt` is there for memory allocation optimization and will
be ignored in the rest of this document.


### The Priority Queue

The Priority Queue described in the article's algorithm implements an
efficient mechanism to determine the *next* notable point hit by the
sweepline, i.e. either a *site* (leading to a *site event*) or a
*vertex* (leading to a *vertex event*).

Theoretically, these would be homogeneous elements put in the same
Priority Queue (PQ) data structure. From an implementation point of view,
though, the PQ is implemented in a half-implicit way as follows:

- all *sites* are known beforehand and are put in an array, sorted by y
  and then by x coordinates. The array is iterated in `voronoi.c` using
  function `nextsite`, that is provided as input. This is an
  implementation trick that allows passing an already sorted list in a
  file and avoid doing the sorting again (as well as reading the whole
  list in memory);

- all *vertices* are discovered along the way and kept in a *sub
  Priority Queue*. As a matter of fact, this contains `Halfedge`s,
  because they contain a pointer to a vertex, which also accounts for
  the presence of member `PQnext` in `Halfedge`. The implementation of
  this *sub Priority Queue* is through a heap and the associated
  *methods* (actually, functions in C) can be found in `heap.c`.

- The *overall* implementation is in `voronoi.c` and, in particular, in
  the way that events are extracted. At each iteration, the bottomest
  *site* is compared against the bottomest *vertex* (in this case, using
  `Halfedge`'s member `ystar`, because the sweepline "lives" in the
  `*`-transformed space) and the lower one is processed, leading to
  either a *site event* or to a *vertex event*.


### The Edge List

The list described in the algorithm is supposed to contain a sequence of
`*`-transformed regions and boundaries, where boundaries are ordered by
x coordinate and regions can appear multiple times.

In the implementation, the Edge List only contains `Halfedge`s, i.e.
parts of the boundaries, and the associated regions can be deduced by
looking at the boundaries (at the end of the day, a $C^-_{pq}$
`Halfedge` has p on the *left* side and q on the *right* side).

For this reason, it is kept as a doubly-linked list of `Halfedge`s; to
make the implementation more compact, the machinery for the
doubly-linked list is drown inside `Halfedge` itself, leading to members
`ELleft` and `ELright`.

There is more to this though. Using a simple doubly-linked list would
defy the algorithm's claim of $n \cdot log(n)$ complexity, because
iterating through it would take $n$ time instead of $log(n)$. Ideally,
this should be implemented with a data structure that allows binary
searching over the list of `Halfedge`s (which would be possible thanks
to the fact that they can be sorted on the x axis).

For this reason, an hash-based mechanism is added on top of the
doubly-linked list, to provide more efficient "entry points" in the list
and speed up the search. After finding the most probable spot as a
starting point, the list is searched towards the left or towards the
right (depending on the relative positions) until the right `Halfedge`
is found. This hash-based mechanism is implemented in `edgelist.c`,
which also contains the logic for searching the closer boundary on the
left of a `Point` (`ELleftbnd@edgelist.c`).


## Site Event - The Right Region in V(\*)

As already indicated in [the first article][voronoi-1], a key part of
Fortune's *original* algorithm is finding the *most interested region*
by the introduction of a new *site*.

The algorithm's description suggests to consider the different sections
of hyperbola and how they intersect to find this out, although this is
arguably a bit vague. Or, maybe, it's explained well in the mathematical
section but I wasn't too sharp in understanding it immediately.

### Skimming through `Halfedge`s

At the high level, when a new *site* is found by the sweep line, the
list of all `Halfedge`s found so far is iterated to find the closest one
that immediately on the left of this new *site*. This is done by function
`ELleftbnd` in file `edgelist.c`. It should ideally be a binary search,
as a matter of fact it's a kind-of linear search optimized with a good
guess on the best *entry point* in the list, via a hash-like mechanism.

Based on the new *site*'s position, the function takes a first guess at
where the most realistic candidate might be in the linked list (this is
done using a sort of "hash-cache" pointing to different positions in the
doubly-linked list of `Halfedge`s), then moves left or right depending
on whether the specific `Halfedge` is on the right of the new *site* or
not.

One source of doubts when reading the algorithm was the claim that the
list of region/branch/region/... is "ordered by the `x` coordinate". I
mean, after the first two sites (assuming they are not aligned
vertically) you always end up with a sequence like this:

~~~~
R* of A   C(BA)-   R* of B   C(BA)+   R* of A
~~~~

While I understand how branches/`Halfedge`s are possibly ordered by the
`x` coordinate, how come that `R* of A` is both on the extreme left and
on the extreme right?

This is of course immediate to understand looking at the following
picture, representing the transformed space.

![Voronoi]({{ '/assets/images/AB-hyperbolic.png' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})

By keeping only `Halfedge`s in the list, and iterating it using
`right_of`, the implementation is indeed capable of leveraging the
ordering by `x`, even though not in the binary search approach suggested
in the article.


### How much above is above?

The key to moving or stopping is function `right_of` implemented in
`geometry.c`. I initially struggled a bit on this, because its naming of
a few variables can be misleading (in particular, the `above` variable
was super-confusing for me). This leads us to the following section.

It has to be kept in mind that all operations in the algorithm are
thought to happen in the transformed space, hence they take into account
the Voronoi diagram in the transformed space instead of the original
diagram. Thanks to the \* transformation introduced by Fortune, all but
the *site*s are pushed up in the plane, so when comparing the `y`
coordinate of two points this has to be taken into account.

The code for `right_of` in `geometry.c` makes a distinction based on
whether the edge line is more "vertical" (i.e. `a == 1.0`) or
"horizontal" (i.e. `b == 1.0`) but, apart from a technical detail
regarding totally vertical lines, the two are equivalent. The latter
case establishes whether the new *site* is above a `Halfedge` like this:

~~~~
else  /*** e->b == 1.0 ***/
    {
    yl = e->c - e->a * p->x ;
    t1 = p->y - yl ;
    t2 = p->x - topsite->coord.x ;
    t3 = yl - topsite->coord.y ;
    above = ((t1*t1) > ((t2 * t2) + (t3 * t3))) ;
    }
~~~~

We will get shortly to why `above` helps us understand whether a *site*
is `right_of` the `Halfedge`. My initial confusion is that the code
above compares the distance of the new Site from the point on the
bisector immediately below against the distance of this latter point
from the `topsite` (it's easy to spot Pythagora's theorem in the
inequality).

Now consider the following picture as an example.

![Voronoi]({{ '/assets/images/XYZV-linear.png' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})

My eyes tell me that site `X` would be above the `Halfedge`, and yet the
algorithm says it isn't: point `V` is mapped onto `Y` by the `*`
transformation, and `X` is below it.

This apparent paradox depends on the fact that the picture is *not*
representing what happens in the transformed space, which is what the
following picture does.

![Voronoi]({{ '/assets/images/XYZV-hyperbolic.png' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})

Now it's indeed clear why `X` lies *below* the `Halfedge` and `Z`
*above* it. It's also easy, at this point, to understand why `above` can
help us understand whether the new *site* is *left* or *right* of the
`Halfedge`: *below* means *left* (like `X`) and *above* means *right*
(like `Z`), at least for a *left* `Halfedge` (the picture shows the
*left* `Halfedge` because it's left of its *base site*, i.e. `B`).
What would happen with a *right* `Halfedge` is easily understood from
the following picture though.

![Voronoi]({{ '/assets/images/XYZV-hyperbolic-right.png' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})

In short, for *right* `Halfedges` the relations are inverted: *above*
means *left* and *below* means *right*. This eventually explains the
return value from function `right_of`:

~~~~
return (el->ELpm == le ? above : !above) ;
~~~~

The condition `el->ELpm` indicates whether it is a *left* `Halfedge`
(the C- part in the algorithm's description inside the article) or a
*right* one (the C+ part). For *left* `Halfedge`s, being on the *right*
is the same as being *above*, otherwise it's the contrary (as we saw
before).


## Wrap Up

Fortune's original implementation helps shed a light on the very
high-level description of the algorithm provided in the original article
from 1987 [A sweepline algorithm for Voronoi
diagrams][fortune-springer], which is also - arguably - the *only*
one that can be called Fortune's algorithm (at least when linking that
paper!).

The implementation is somehow optimized and not really easy to follow,
because optimizations (like memory management) are intermixed to enhance
performance. Still it's been very instructive to read it and hopefully
understand it as well.
