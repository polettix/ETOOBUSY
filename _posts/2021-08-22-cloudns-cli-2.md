**TL;DR**

> A little update on this project.

I should really put this somewhere under tracking, but I was eager to
see it working and it does. I'll hopefully put it in a git repository
tomorrow.

The prototype supports listing, adding a few record types and deleting
them by identifier.

It might also be interesting to add an interactive interface... time
will tell.

Stay safe everyone!
