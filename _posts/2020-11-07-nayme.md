**TL;DR**

> [nayme][] is (yet) another Fantasy Name Generator.

While waiting for an answer to a proposal for including the parser
described in [Fantasy Name Generator - a parser][] into [fantasyname][]
(see issue [Interested in a better Perl version?][]), I've decided to
publish the code in a slightly more polished form.

[nayme][] just requires [Perl][] 5.024 or later to run. It should not be
an issue because... heck, we're in 2020 as of this writing!

Just a few usage examples:

```
# list available templates (only internal ones)
nayme --list

# list available templates (internal & in file "definitions.json")
nayme -f definitions.json -l

# generate 20 fake "Greek" names 
nayme --count 20 --template GREEK_NAMES

# generate 1 fantasy name according to the specification
nayme -s "BV(|||'|-)Cs"
```

For the details, you're invited to read the [README.md][] file, it's not
big and should get you up to speed in no time. Enjoy!
