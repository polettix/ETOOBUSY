**TL;DR**

> A workaround for putting files in a [Kubernetes][] [Pod][].

If you want to put a file in a [Kubernetes][] [Pod][], the way to go is
*usually* the command [`kubectl cp ...`][kubectl-cp].

Alas, this requires that the target Pod has `tar` installed. Which... might
not always be the case.

**IF** the target Pod has a working shell, though, you can use the program
below, like this:

```shell
kube-put /path/to/local/file /path/inside/pod/file <kubectl exec params>
```

where `<kubectl exec params>` will be the parameters you would normally use
to execute something in the target Pod/container, e.g. setting the
*namespace* with option `-n`, providing the name of the Pod and optionally
providing the name of the target container with option `-c`. Example:

```shell
kube-put $(which kube-put) /tmp/kube-put \
    -n my-namespace pod/my-pod-name -c my-pod-container-name
```

Here is the program ([local version here][]):

<script src="https://gitlab.com/polettix/notechs/-/snippets/2041859.js"></script>

You **MUST** specify the target *filename*, putting the target directory is
not sufficient. You are welcome to provide patches ðŸ˜„

The program tries to auto-detect if `base64` is installed in the target
system and, if not, use a (slow) shell-based alternative (you might have
recognized the code from [A POSIX shell-only Base64 decoder][]). You can
*force* the use of the shell-base alternative by setting environment
variable `USE_EMBEDDED_BASE64` to value `1` (any other value will be
ignored).

Happy transferring!
