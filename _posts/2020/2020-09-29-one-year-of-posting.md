**TL;DR**

> So... it seems that it's this blog's birthday!

One year ago I started this *simpler* blog because... I felt that the
main blog was lagging too much behind. It has some posts that I consider
nice, but writing them usually required me a lot of time.

So I thought... why not write about stuff as it comes? And this blog was
born.

Until the end of the last year it got a few posts and was about to be
forgotten... then I took the challenge with myself to try and produce a
post per day. So far it was *almost* successful, with two breaks (in May
and in June) that were a consequence of *ubi major minor cessat*. Let's
say that 2020 will be remembered ðŸ˜…

While this place is still faithful to its original spirit - it's still
possible to use it and blog entirely through [GitHub][] - I added some
features in time of which I'm quite happy, among which:

- [ETOOBUSY automated publishing][]
- [Notifications for busypub][]
- [Blog post publishing: merciless lazyness][]

are my favourite, because I feel that they *really* get the recurrent
burden out of me and allow me to *just write*. More can be found under
tag [#blog][].

As a final note, let's always remember that I'm standing on the giant's
shoulder, like described in a post from one year ago: [Jekyll blog on
GitHub Pages][].
