**TL;DR**

My [Pinboard][] bookmarks tend to accumulate stuff I find *interesting*
on the spot, but just for... later. This blog will probably see some of
them from time to time, just to let them *emerge* from the sea of
bookmarks.

Today's link is about a website that explains the basic concepts of
[Git][]: [A Grip on Git][]. I found that while looking for a simple
website to point a few colleagues to, and it's the kind of clear
explanation that provides you with the basic concepts to understand
what's going on.
