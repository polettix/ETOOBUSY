**TL;DR**

> At the very last, some cards.

In the specific, eight decks of cards like the following ones:

![ace of hearts]({{ '/assets/images/cards/red-A-hearts-_-_-_.svg' | prepend: site.baseurl }})
![seven of diamonds]({{ '/assets/images/cards/red-7-diamonds-hops-_-_.svg' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

![ten of clubs]({{ '/assets/images/cards/black-T-clubs-hops-corn-acorn.svg' | prepend: site.baseurl }})
![queen of spades]({{ '/assets/images/cards/black-Q-spades-_-_-acorn.svg' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

[All cards here][].

The three *led* slots are used to optionally host one single icon each
(hops, corn, acorn). They're like bits, so for three slots you get eight
combination and eight decks (should you need it).

The icons are [CC BY 3.0][] from [game-icons.net][]:

- [hearts][], [diamonds][], [clubs][], and [spades][] by
  [Skoll][game-icons.net]
- [hops][] and [corn] by [Delapouite][]
- [acorn][] by [Lorc][]

Soon I'll hopefully share the script to do this...
