**TL;DR**

> Where I designed my first origami.

Well, I'm not *claiming* that I'm the first to devise this design, but I
surely played with a piece of paper enough to figure out all creases
from scratch, which gave me the *pleasure* to invent it. Possibly again.

The crease pattern is the following:

![origami tuckbox creases]({{ '/assets/images/origami-tuckbox.svg' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

which can also be downloaded [here][].

The crease pattern all remains in the inside once the whole thing is
folded and closed.

There is a layer named `Visible (reverse side)` (invisible by default)
that represents the other side of the page with respect to the crease
pattern, to give you an idea of where to put pictures (if you want any).
You can print the patterns and avoid that layer to save some ink, this
is why it's hidden by default.

My suggestion is to print on heavy paper/cardstock and use a pen to
*prepare* all creases. Once you get the valley and mountain folds right
you should not have problems wrapping the box and closing it.

I did one for some cards I printed and it makes for a nice box ðŸ˜Ž
