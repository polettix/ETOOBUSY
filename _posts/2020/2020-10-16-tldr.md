**TL;DR**

> I discovered [tldr][] and siblings.

Like a politician would say, *different manpages are possible!*

I recently discovered [tldr][] and the **tldr-pages** project:

> The **tldr-pages** project is a collection of community-maintained
> help pages for command-line tools, that aims to be a simpler, more
> approachable complement to traditional [man pages][].

I like how it eats its own dog food:

```
$ tldr tldr

  Displays simple help pages for command-line tools, from the
  tldr-pages project.
  More information: <https://tldr.sh>.

  ✓ Get typical usages of a command (hint: this is how you got here!):

    🍣  tldr {{command}}

  ✓ Show the tar tldr page for Linux:

    🍣  tldr -p {{linux}} {{tar}}

  ✓ Get help for a git subcommand:

    🍣  tldr {{git-checkout}}

  ✓ Update local pages (if the client supports caching):

    🍣  tldr -u
```

The output is actually more colorful than shown above, but even this
example gives the gist of what this project is about: providing
meaningful examples of typical usage for the command.

**WAIT A MINUTE YOU SON OF AN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-SH BREACH!**

This is the whole idea behind the venerable `SYNOPSIS` section in all
*decent* [Perl][] documentation! Time and again [Perl][] proved to be
a cornucopia of (practical) ideas worth stealing, good job!  🤩

If you're interested, there is a [Perl client][perl-tldr], which is of
course what I installed myself... so happy reading!
