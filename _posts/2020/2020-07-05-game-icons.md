**TL;DR**

If you're looking for a *lot* of icons with a consistent style and that
you can use under the [CC BY 3.0][], you should definitely give
[game-icons.net][] a look.

Here's a few personal considerations:

- **plus**: as of this post, there are 3817 icons;
- **plus**: the license only requires attribution, which is fair IMHO;
- **plus**: icons are available in both PNG and SVG format (which also
  provides amazing resizing capabilities, of course);
- **plus**: you an get all icons in a single sweep (the ZIP archive for
  SVG icons is less than 4 megabytes);
- **cons**: metadata (e.g. categorization into tags) is not available
  for download.

Another big **plus** is that every icon is basically formed by two
paths, one square for the background and one *shaped* for the
foreground. Which will be more interesting in the days to come.
