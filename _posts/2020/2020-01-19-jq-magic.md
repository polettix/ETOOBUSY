**TL;DR**

> [jq][] can do wonders to read JSON files and produce some output.

In recent post [Thread of tweets via API][mojox-twitter-post-3] we saved a
thread of tweets as a JSON file. The format, though, is what comes out
directly from the [Twitter API][], which might be too much or too...
*opinionated*.

We're up to serve tweets as little gems, but we might as well use the same
software to provide wisdom from different sources... so we want to stick to
a format that is good for *us*.

## A simple target format

Without further ado, here's our skeleton/example for a format:

```json
{
   "title": "whatever"
   "url": "http://from.where.this/came/from",
   "quotes": [
      {
         "text": "whatever 1",
         "url": "http://from.where.this/came/1",
      },
      {
         "text": "...",
         "url": "..."
      }
   ]
}
```

This should be a good starting point: we can define an overall title and a
URL to provide further context (or, at the bare minimum, acknowledgment to
the real source) and a list of *quotes*, each comprising at least some text
to display and, if available, a specific URL (like we would have with tweets
in a thread, for example).

## Turning to the format

The output from our [Twitter API][] invocation is different from our target
format, but here [jq][] can come to the rescue with some filtering
capabilities:

```
jq <twitter-thread.json >quotes.json \
   '{
      "title": "QuinnyPig on Presenting",
      "url": "https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1215710451343904768",
      "quotes": [
         .[] | {
            "text": .full_text,
            "url": ("https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/" + (.id | tostring))
         }
      ]
   }'
```

There's something to digest so let's add some numbering:

```
 1 jq <twitter-thread.json >quotes.json \
 2    '{
 3       "title": "QuinnyPig on Presenting",
 4       "url": "https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1215710451343904768",
 5       "quotes": [
 6          .[] | {
 7             "text": .full_text,
 8             "url": ("https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/" + (.id | tostring))
 9          }
10       ]
11    }'
```

In a nutshell:

- the overall output is a single object (like we want) - this is the sense
  of *wrapping* everything inside braces (lines 2 and 11);
- data that are specific to the thread we collected can be put as *simple*
  stuff in the output JSON (lines 3 and 4);
- the tweets we saved from the [Twitter API][] (that we are reading from a
  file named `twitter-thread.json`, line 1) are inside an array that we want
  to iterate (line 6 `.[]`);
- the output of the iteration has to go back into an array (lines 5 and 10,
  i.e. enclosing the output inside square brackets);
- for each object in the input array, we want to produce an object out
  (braces in lines 6 and 9);
- objects in the array contain `text` taken from [Twitter API][]'s
  `full_text` and a URL built from the tweet's `id`


## That's it!

Enough for today... be sure to take a look at [jq][] and also consider
making it part of your [#toolbox][] because yes, you can also find
statically compiled versions in the [download][] page!
