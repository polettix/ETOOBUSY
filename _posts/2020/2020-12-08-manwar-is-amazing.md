**TL;DR**

> [Mohammad Sajid Anwar][manwar] is amazing.

In [last week][#089]'s [Perl Weekly Challenge][] I had everything prepared -
the code, the blog posts - BUT I forgot to push my contribution in my fork
and generate a pull request for it.

When this week's challenge arrived in my inbox, I realized how dump I am and
went to fix this. Only to find... that the code and the blog posts are
already in the main repository!

This got me a bit uneasy because it might have been some hidden persona
inside me doing this without telling the other ones. You already know [I
have many][previous-post]. Scary.

As it goes, it's just the opposite. [Mohammad Sajid Anwar][manwar] is an
awesome human, and got that fixed for me behin the scenes! In the same week
when I declared my *hatred*!

I am a fool ðŸ¤ª. Twice ðŸ¤ª
