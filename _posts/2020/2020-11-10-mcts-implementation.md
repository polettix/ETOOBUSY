**TL;DR**

We already scratched the surface about this algorithm in previous post
[Monte Carlo Tree Search - basics][]. I've found that many times it's better
to bang my head over an implementation so that I can really understand the
ins and outs of an algorithm.

The implementation (in [Perl][], of course!) can be found at
[MonteCarloTreeSearch.pm][], with some documentation at
[MonteCarloTreeSearch.pod][]. And yes, I should really, really start to
write proper tests for all this stuff.

Or, for what matters, start using it in [CodinGame][] ðŸ™„

My plan is to comment a bit on the code in the future posts... so stay
tuned!
