**TL;DR**

> [Inconsolation][] is a great resource in the internet.

It's about time that I pay homage to [Inconsolation][], a fine series of
blog posts about *everything terminal* that has been both of great
inspiration for my blog (up to style and intermix of emojis) and as a source
of interesting things too.

So thank you very much K. Mandla, whoever you happen to be.

And just because I'd like to steal just a piece of advice, today I learned
that you can run [top][], press the `z` key, and enjoy:

Find more at [top: The cool tool you didn’t know you had][] and have fun!
