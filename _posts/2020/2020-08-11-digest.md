**TL;DR**

> [Digest][] comes handy for generating quick and dirty identifiers.

From time to time it happens that I have to generate some reasonably
*unique* identifier. There are of course libraries to do this ([UUID][]
comes to mind), but sometimes they are overkill.

In addition to be unique, it's good if this identifier is also
restricted to a set of characters, e.g. it has no spaces or other
non-alphanumeric stuff; this can ease e.g. parsing of some output at a
later stage.

For this occasions, I think [Digest][] offers a reasonable low-cost
alternative, for example using directly one of the implementation
([Digest::MD5][] in this specific case):


```shell
$ perl -MDigest::MD5=md5_hex -le 'print md5_hex(time() . rand())'
fa1e572e21fcaeb899c67a0c687a4cb7
$ perl -MDigest::MD5=md5_hex -le 'print md5_hex(time() . rand())'
6401fdf48cdb4c7920148ff335d82550
```

Of course you can pre-pend a specific letter or the character `_` if you
want what a programming language would normally consider an identifier,
as well as cut it to a specific length if it's too many characters.

```shell
$ perl -MDigest::MD5=md5_hex \
    -le 'print substr "_" . md5_hex(time() . rand()), 0, 15'
_327b39ebed019f
$ perl -MDigest::MD5=md5_hex \
    -le 'print substr "_" . md5_hex(time() . rand()), 0, 15'
_b13534165e173d
```

Cheers!
