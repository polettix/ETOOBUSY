**TL;DR**

So I thought: why not do a *print and play* version, possibly re-interpreted in
some different theme?

Enter the [Spatial Game of Ur][], a PDF version in *spatial* theme. If you are
interested, you can also grab the [SVG version][]. The image below is a PNG, so
you should be covered!

A summary of the rules is written in the *print and play* itself; I suggest
watching video [Tom Scott vs Irving Finkel: The Royal Game of Ur | PLAYTHROUGH
| International Tabletop Day 2017][ur-video] if you want to understand the game
mechanics. In the *print and play* version, only the square slots belong to
the path, not the colored ends!

The game is supposed to be played using four tetrahedral dice, each providing
either a 0 or a 1 at each roll (there are two 0s and two 1s). Whatever can give
you out 0 or 1 is fine, though; for example four coins (heads is 0, tails is 1)
or any even-sided dice (even values are 0, odd values are 1).

If you're more like trying the game online, you can head to [Your Turn My
Turn][ur-online]... Have fun!
