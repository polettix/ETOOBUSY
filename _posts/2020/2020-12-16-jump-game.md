**TL;DR**

> On with [TASK #2][] from the [Perl Weekly Challenge][] [#091][].
> Enjoy!

# The challenge

> You are given an array of positive numbers `@N`, where value at each index
> determines how far you are allowed to jump further. Write a script to
> decide if you can jump to the last index. Print 1 if you are able to reach
> the last index otherwise 0.

# The questions

The challenge is pretty clear, apart from a detail... is `@N` really
composed of *positive numbers* only? That `0` in the second example looks a
bit out of place 🧐

# The solution

Here we go:

```perl
sub jump_game ($N) {
   my $position = 0;
   $position += $N->[$position] while $position < $#$N && $N->[$position];
   return $position == $#$N ? 1 : 0;
}
```

Here, it's really just a matter of following the crumbs. We start with our
`$position` tracker at index `0`, then advance it according to the contents
of the array, taking a few cares:

- if the index goes exactly on the last spot or beyond, it's time to stop;
- if the jump length is `0` we stop as well... and avoid an infinite loop!

After the loop terminates, it's a matter of figuring if we landed to the
last position or not.

Have a good one!
