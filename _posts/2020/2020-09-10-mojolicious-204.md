**TL;DR**

> Set `status` to `204` *AND* pass an empty `text`/`data` too.

Every now and then I'm coding a web API and I need to send back an empty
response, which is HTTP status code `204` (also known as *No Content*).

This is how to do it properly in [Mojolicious][], the real-time web
framework for [Perl][]:

```perl
$c->render(status => 204, data => '');
```

It has tripped me so many times:

- about 90% of them I use(d) `code` instead of `status`;
- I keep (hopefully kept) to leave out the `data` part because it just
  seems right (if status is 204, why bother?).

I hope writing this will help me avoid the bug the next time!

**Update**: this suggestion from `preaction` in the comments below is
shorter and *maybe* easier to remember:

```perl
$c->rendered(204);
```

I say maybe because I pretty much never use `rendered`, so it's likely
I'll forget it ğŸ™„
