**TL;DR**

> [JSON::PP][] is a CORE module in [Perl][] since some time now...

I've always been fond of CORE modules in [Perl][] because not always I
have access to easy installing of modules from [CPAN][] and not always I
can use [Docker][] to pack everything as I need. So... it's just easy to
assume that the module will be there. Unless you're using RedHat, of
course.

[JSON][] files are super-handy to manage configurations and it might not
be widely known that [JSON::PP][] is in CORE since some time:

```shell
$ corelist JSON::PP
...
JSON::PP was first released with perl v5.13.9
```

Considering that release 5.14 dates back to May 2011... it's more than 9
years!

Maybe the *pure perl* implementation will not be what you need for a
super-fast API, but for the casual reading or generation of a JSON file
it does the trick.

In my opinion... an unsung hero.
