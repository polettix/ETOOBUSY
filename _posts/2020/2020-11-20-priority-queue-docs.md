**TL;DR**

> Where I fill a gap after feeling ashame.

In post [PWC087 - Largest Rectangle][] I leveraged the [PriorityQueue.pm][]
implementation in [cglib][] to solve part of the problem.

And I felt all the shame for not having documented it ðŸ˜“

So I tried to fix this... by adding some docs in [PriorityQueue.pod][]. I
hope it makes it more useable!
