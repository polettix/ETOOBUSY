**TL;DR**

> Here we are with [TASK #1][] from the [Perl Weekly Challenge][]
> [#089][]. Enjoy!

# The challenge

> You are given a positive integer `$N`. Write a script to sum GCD of all
> possible unique pairs between `1` and `$N`.

# The questions

I can only guess that an input of `1` yields a `0`, which is probably
something that can be argued. Is the sum of "nothing" `0`?

But apart from this and what to do with invalid input... I can't find
anything particularly *naggy* to ask.

# The solution

I have to be honest: I *hate* [manwar][].

Oh wait! Don't get me wrong! My *hate* is in the same spirit as *lazyness*,
*impatience* and *hubris* are the virtues of a programmer - i.e. I do in a
very particular (and humorous) sense.

Well... where does this *hatred* come from? It's simple: not only these
challenges force me to *think*, but more often than I'm willing to admit
they make me feel a combination of *stupid* and *lazy* (in a bad sense).

For so many of them there's an inner voice that tells me that my simple,
boring, immediate go-to solution is not really what we are supposed to come
up with. Then there's another inner voice that argues that it's a solution
and it might be good in a lot of situation, so until we (at this point it's
a mess of inner personas talking) know that it's not sufficient the problem
is not worth any more time.

And yet there's an inner party (yes, all these personas had to organize and
elect a leader because there were too many of them) that argues that these
challenges are supposed to emerge our thought process, and I tend to lean on
the boring, inefficient side a bit *too much*.

So there I am thinking a lot, with a plethora of persona arguing in my head,
and with the sensation that yes, there's got to be a better way to do the
task. OK, I'll wait to read it from [Abigail][]'s solution this week too ðŸ˜‚

So... let's come to the task at hand. This time I'll go straight to the
solution:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl
use 5.024;
use warnings;
use experimental qw< postderef signatures >;
no warnings qw< experimental::postderef experimental::signatures >;

sub gcd { my ($A, $B) = @_; ($A, $B) = ($B % $A, $A) while $A; return $B }

sub GCD_sum ($N) {
   my $sum = $N - 1; # gcd(1, $x) = 1
   for my $lo (2 .. $N - 1) {
      $sum += gcd($lo, $_) for $lo + 1 .. $N;
   }
   return $sum;
}

say GCD_sum(shift || 4);
```

The `gcd` function is just [Euclid's algorithm][] in a one-liner.

The main function starts the sum from `$N - 1` because the greatest common
divisor by any positive integer and `1` is just... `1`. We are dealing with
*distinct* pairs, so we cannot count $(1, 1)$.

The two nested loops make sure that there's no pair of integers, and just
calculates the greatest common divisor betewen any possible applicable pair.

I guess this *might* be enhanced but... well, go back to the start of this
section!
