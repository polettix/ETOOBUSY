**TL;DR**

It sometimes happens that a program needs to know whether a [Git][]
working directory is in a *dirty* state or not, i.e. if [Git][] thinks
that there might be something to be done or not.

As an example, if you modify a tracked file then the situation is
*dirty* because you haven't committed the changes yet. Similarly, if you
have a file that is neither tracked nor ignored, then again you have a
*dirty* situation because you should clarify your intentions with
respect to this file and lower down [Git][]'s stress level. It's so
sensitive.

One interesting discussion about it can be found in [Checking for a
dirty index or untracked files with Git][]. My personal take-away is
that the command:

```shell
git status --porcelain
```

is everything I need, because it tells everything that [Git][] is not
totally fine with. It's also [one of the answers][].

If you need a *true*/*false* test, you can use this:

```shell
is_git_dirty() { [ -n "$(git status --porcelain)" ]; }
```

The typical use case that makes me look for this trick from time to time
is packing stuff in a [Git][]-tracked directory, e.g. via `git archive`
or using `git ls-files`. I would certainly not want to pack something
that is *dirty*, would I?
