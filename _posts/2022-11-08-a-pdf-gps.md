**TL;DR**

> Finding our way with [A PDF workaround][].

In latest post [A PDF workaround][] we saw that we don't need no
stinkin' PDF forms to merge a starting PDF with some data
programmatically.

The elephant in the room, of course, is finding out *where* the
different text parts should be placed.

Here there's a catch. Coordinates in a PDF file must have been designed
by a mathematician and not a programmer, because they have their origin
in the lower-left corner and have increasing Y coordinates going up. No
big deal, just a bit counterintuitive to add stuff going *further* down
the page, and *decrease* the corresponding coordinate.

I was surprised by the lack of support for coordinates spotting in the
tools that are widely available around, notably the Preview program in
MacOS and Acrobat Reader in Windows. Well, maybe the latter is not so
surprising after all.

Luckily enough, [GIMP][] comes to the rescue (thanks to [this QA in
Stackoverflow][sogimp]). I found this procedure to be spot on:

- start [GIMP][]
- open the base PDF page, setting **720 points per inch**
- flip the image vertically

At this point, the resulting image should have a good resolution and
**the cursor will indicate the (typical) coordinates values multiplied
by 10** (i.e. `(2000, 1875)` in [GIMP][] coordinates actually means
`(200.0, 187.5)` in PDF coordinates).

It's also possible to open the file with 72 points per inch, of course,
but in my example PDF files this led to a blocky image with a lot of
uncertainty about the correct positioning of my reference elements.

Stay coordinated!
