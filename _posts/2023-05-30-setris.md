**TL;DR**

> [Setris][] is a great idea.

I'm not *much* into videogames, in that I only play a few of them but not
too much.

As a matter of fact, I'm **scared** to play a couple of games. They might
make me forget about what I should do at night, and hear birds sing the
morning after. But I'm digressing.

I read about [Setris][] and I think it's a fantastic idea. I mean, I will
probably *not* download/play it, just like I don't usually play Tetris;
nonetheless, the twist to the base game is genius. It's the kind of things
that make me feel how simple would be to think stuff, and yet also feel that
I'm not really capable of it.

I had a similar feeling in front of the many interpretations of [Las Meninas
by Pablo Picasso][]. I saw and realized that they were just a few, quick
strokes, *and yet I was also pretty aware that I couldn't possibly do them
myself*. Both humbling and *amazing*.

Stay safe!
