**TL;DR**

> I added class [Data::Resolver::Asset][] class.

In previous post [Reflections after a couple of weeks of
Data::Resolver][post] I discussed a bit about evolving
[Data::Resolver][] to provide an easier/more intuitive way of working.

The first step in that direction is [Data::Resolver::Asset][], not yet
on [CPAN][].

The [POD is here][], although unfortunately [Codeberg][] does not have a
*do what I mean* way of rendering it. So I will cheat a bit and put [a
never-updated markdown rendition here][POD also here].

Stay safe and resolved!
