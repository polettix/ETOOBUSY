**TL;DR**

> [Challenge 37][] in [Cryptopals][].

You know when I wrote that cryptographic stuff MUST be used exactly as
written on the can? Well, sometimes there is stuff that has not been
written there yet!

The challenge commentary is worth citing here:

This is indeed *excellent*, much like the [Egg of Colombo][]. One of
those things that, in hindsight, make you realize *I could have thought
of that*. But you didn't.

As attackers, our goal is to get in, which might mean figuring out the
right HMAC for the provided salt, which might mean figuring out the key
$K$, which might mean figuring out the value for shared secret $S$.

So let's look at the math as used by the *server*:

$$
S = (A \cdot v^u) ^ b \pmod N \\
S = (A ^ b \cdot v^{u\cdot b}) \pmod N \\
S = (A ^ b \pmod N) \cdot (v^{u \cdot b}) \pmod N
$$

The *client* is providing $A$, so what happens if it's a multiple of
$N$? Simple: any of is non-zero powers is a multiple of $N$ as well,
which means (remember that $b \ne 0$):

$$
A = i \cdot N \\
\Rightarrow (A^b \pmod N) = 0 \\
\Rightarrow S = 0
$$

This means: we can force our own known value of $S$ onto the *server*,
even withouth knowing the password.

On the code side, this is relatively easy to accomplish, starting from
our previous code. It suffices to code a *rogue* client (as a subclass
of the previous *normal* client) that forces the public key to be a
multiple of $N$ (according to our own provided value of $i$, represented
by parameter `fake_key_factor`) and then uses $S = 0$ to compute the
authenticator:

```perl
package SRPRogueClientSession;
use v5.24;
use warnings;
use experimental 'signatures';
no warnings 'experimental::signatures';
use parent -norequire => 'SRPClientSession';
use Math::BigInt;

sub init ($self) {
   $self->{public_key} = $self->{fake_key_factor} * $self->{p};
}

sub login_phase2 ($self, $salt, $server_public_key) {
   my $K = $self->sha256(0);
   return $self->hmac_sha256($K, $salt);
}
```

The rest is the same as before, with a slight change on which client
implementation we decide to use, depending on the password provided on
the command line:

```perl
my %args = (I => $email, P => $password);
my $client;
if (($password // '/0') =~ m{\A / (\d+)}mxs) {
   $client = SRPRogueClientSession->new(%args, fake_key_factor => $1);
}
else {
   $client = SRPClientSession->new(%args);
}
```

All password matching regular expression `/(\d+)` result in using a
rogue client, *aaaaand*:

```
# this is with the right password
$ perl 37-cnt.pl foo@bar.baz xxx
we're in!

# this is with the wrong password
$ perl 37-cnt.pl foo@bar.baz YYYYY
no luck...

# A = 0
$ perl 37-cnt.pl foo@bar.baz /0
we're in!

# A = N
$ perl 37-cnt.pl foo@bar.baz /1
we're in!

# A = 7N
$ perl 37-cnt.pl foo@bar.baz /7
we're in!

# you get the idea...
```

Stay safe *and secure*!
