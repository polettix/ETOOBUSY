**TL;DR**

> On with [Advent of Code][] [puzzle 11][p11] from [2016][aoc2016]: a
> solution for **part 2**, at the very last!

In previous post [AoC 2016/11 - New successors][previous-post] we took a
look a the last piece we needed to set up our search using
[AstarX.pm][], so without further ado we can proceed:

```perl
my $outcome = astar(
   start      => $start,
   goal       => $goal,
   distance   => sub { return 1 },
   heuristic  => \&distance_to_goal,
   identifier => \&id_of,
   successors => \&successors_for,
);
say scalar($outcome->@*) - 1;
```

Now let's run it ([local version here][]):

```
$ time perl 11.pl 11.input2
57

real	3m37.668s
user	3m30.664s
sys	0m2.312s
```

Well well... not *too terribly* fast, but it's still a *reasonable time*
and it *only* got to about 1.2 GB of memory... which is fine for my
resources.

So... now that I have eventually cracked down this puzzle, I can happily
head to the [reddit post about this puzzle][] and look through all the
wild ideas that people had to improve efficiency.

It's rewarding to be able to do this by having solved the puzzle myself
without specific hints, and it's thrilling that there is still so much
to discover! For example, the [top post][] for [this code in Ruby][]
says:

> The code runs in about two seconds on my computer.

*Now I'm intrigued!!!*
