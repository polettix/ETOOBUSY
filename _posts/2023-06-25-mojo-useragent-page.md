**TL;DR**

> Starting with new, wider-range pages at [Mojo::UserAgent][notes].

Some time ago (well... 2+ years ago!) I put together some info about
[Mojo::UserAgent][] that I found useful *and* something I was after every
now and then.

Alas, the *blog post* approach is not the best when you realize that there
are missing bits that you *also* are after more often than you are willing
to admit.

So I decided to [turn that material into a *page*][notes]. Apart from adding
stuff that I *also* find useful, this gives me the peace of mind of leaving
blog posts as a testimony of my ignor**AHEM**effort to learn stuff.

This also marks, as already promised multiple times in the past, the end of
my daily blogging, at least in a form that can be of some use to people
beyond *future me*. It's been a funny ride with 3 years of uninterrupted
blog posts production, but other aspects of `$life` need energies and, as
everybody, there's a limited amount of them!

Cheers!
