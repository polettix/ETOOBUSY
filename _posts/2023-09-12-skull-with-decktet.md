**TL;DR**

> Playing [Skull][] with the [Decktet][] is pretty straightforward.

If you happen to have a deck of the [Decktet][], you can easily play
[Skull][] too:

- use the "Aces" as skulls
- use the "Kings" as point counters
- use any triple of numbered cards as roses (e.g. first player takes all
  twos, second player all threes, and so on).

That's it! It even supports up to 6 players like the original game.

It's also possible to use a regular deck of cards, although it can be
challenging to go beyond 4 players (still possible but a little
"abstract").

Cheers!
