**TL;DR**

> Collecting info and tricks in [a specific page about Mojolicious][mojopage]

In previous post [Mojo::UserAgent specific page, and a salutation][] I
digressed a bit about aggregating some content from the blog into standalone
pages that can be more easily evolved. So I started this for my notes about
[Mojolicious][] too, in [its own page][mojopage].

The section about authentication is still empty... but I figured that maybe
it should go in a page on its own.

Stay safe!
