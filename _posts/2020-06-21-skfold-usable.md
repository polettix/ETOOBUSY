**TL;DR**

> After a bit of tinkering, [skfold][] starts to be useful.

In [Restart from skfold][skfold-first] I introduced a little project
([skfold][]) that aims at allowing to *mint everything*, i.e. produce
the initial scaffolding for a project.

It is already usable for my goals, and I've added a few initial
templates that will hopefully prove useful (one for [Perl][]
distributions, one for [dibs][] files).

In the coming days, hopefully, I'll elaborate more on it!
