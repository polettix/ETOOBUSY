**TL;DR**

> I added graph visit algorithms to [cglib-raku][].

In a slow learning of [Raku][], I'm continuing to work on [cglib-raku][]
and I added two algorithms to visit a graph, i.e.
[BreadthFirstVisit.rakumod][] and [DepthFirstVisit.rakumod][].

They are pretty much a translation of their counterparts in [Perl][]. I
took the occasion to make their interfaces uniform, adding hooks where
they were missing. It's also nice to be able to add a `MAIN` function
with some basic tests.

Now I hope there will be some *challenge* that will allow me to use
them ðŸ˜Ž
