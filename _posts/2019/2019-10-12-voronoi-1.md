Voronoi diagrams started fascinating me a couple years ago... and I'm still
trying hard to grasp how to manage them properly!

## Where It Started

As it often happens, it all started playing.

This time I was playing by solving programming problems in
[CodingGame][] (which I strongly recommend, by the way, if you like
programming). Some puzzle might require to get the nearest location
where there is *something*, and this is where [Voronoi
diagrams][voronoi-wikipedia] usually pop up.

In a nutshell in 2D, given some fixed *sites* (e.g. where your possible
targets are located), the Voronoi diagram represents how the plane can
be divided so that each *site* is surrounded by a *region* of points
that are closer to that *site* more than every other. Something like
this:

![vononoi-wikipedia-png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Euclidean_Voronoi_diagram.svg/500px-Euclidean_Voronoi_diagram.svg.png)

So, for example, any point in the gray area in the low-left corner is
closer to the black dot inside that area than - say - to the black dot
inside the pink area immediately above on the left border.


## ... Now I Have Two Problems

It turns out I never really used Voronoi diagrams in [CodingGame][], at
least not so far. Never say never. There are a couple of reasons:

- first of all, there's no pure-[Perl][] implementation that I could
  find. Well, of course I could think of implementing it, but this led
  me to the second reason...

- *using* the Voronoid tessellation is not exactly straightforward. Even
  if I could land on a good description of all polygons associated to
  each site, I would *still* have to figure out how to find the right
  polygon for the generic query point. There are of course algorithms to
  do that (we'll get there, hopefully), but still.

Long story short, using Voronoi diagrams to get the closer *site*
efficiently actually involves two algorithms:

- one to compute the Voronoi diagram efficiently, and
- one to query the diagram with a generic poing, again efficiently.

It's a lot of work... and I didn't invest the time. Two years ago, at
least.


## Being Honest

To be very, very honest: if it were very easy to implement the first
algorithm, I would have probably done that already and proceeded to the
second. It turns out that getting the Voronoi tessellation right can be
quite tricky. This is being honest with my willpower.

But.

We have also to be honest with another fact: the most *famous* algorithm
around, one which I think that today is almost always used and
implemented, is a bit complicated and also... a mess to get info about.
I'm obviously talking about the algorithm by [Steven
Fortune][sjf-archive-org] described in article [A sweepline algorithm
for Voronoi diagrams][fortune-springer], published in 1987.

Or am I?!?


## Fortune's Algorithm Is Not What Most People Think

Taking a step back, I turned to [Wikipedia's page on Fortune's
algorithm][fortune-wikipedia] to take a look at it. Please note: the
link is to an *hopefully obsolete* version of the page in Wikipedia,
more or less the one I read in the beginning of my quest. And it's a
mess.

Long story short:

- the algorithm's **description** is about a *sweepline* that eventually
  computes the Voronoi diagram. It uses sections of *parabolas* cleverly
  assembled in a *shoreline* to allow for using a sweepline algorithm,
  but of course it's a description and something more formal can help;

- the algorithm's **pseudocode** is about a *sweepline* that eventually
  computes the Voronoi diagram, BUT... it has nothing to do with the one
  in the description! As a matter of fact, it's a copy-paste from
  article [An Efficient Implementation of Fortune’s Plane-Sweep
  Algorithm for Voronoi Diagrams][wong-muller] by Kenny Wong and Hausi
  A.  Müller, which is inspired to the original algorithm described by
  Fortune.

To add misunderstanding to confusion, the picture associated to the
**description** shows a sweep from left to right, while the
**pseudocode** is about a line that goes from bottom to top!

Practically all implementation and blogs I found around refer to the
shoreline of parabolas description and specifically indicate that as
Fortune's algorithm, which is confusing at its best and about wrong
according to the algorithm's pseudocode.

In these cases, I find it helpful to look directly at the original
source, i.e. [Fortune's article][fortune-springer]. I have to say that
it's a clever piece of maths (we will get to that shortly), but a few
things are pretty evident:

- the shoreline is nowhere to be found
- there's no parabola in it, but hyperbola instead!

So, arguably, a whole lot of people are referring to Fortune's algorithm
without having really read it. It took me some time to digest this, I
couldn't believe it.


## What Fortune Really Says

Fortune started from the consideration that using a sweepline algorithm
directly is not straightforward because at any time during a sweep only
sites' positions are known, not all intersections between segments
(a.k.a. *vertices*) which are also points of interest. Alas, most of the
times a *vertex*'s position can only be found *after* analyzing a *site*
that is *beyond* that *vertex*. If only there was a way...

Well, Fortune found a way. He designed a clever transformation of the
plane that makes it finally possible to use a *sweepline* (i.e. a line
that sweeps the plane only moving in one direction) to get a division of
the plane that, when counter-transformed, provides the Voronoi diagram.
The transformation is called `*`; it is not *one-to-one* everywhere, but
it is indeed *one-to-one* where it's needed, i.e. on the Voronoi
diagram.

Fortune's algorithm is described after a considerable amount of maths
that demonstrates the properties of the transformation condensed in the
previous paragraph. The algorithm is described in about half a page and
is, indeed, quite similar to the pseudocode of Wikipedia's page,
although it at least takes the time to describe all symbols. Thanks!

From my limited capabilities, though, I'd say that the algorithm in the
original paper is not really immediate. One key part - finding the
*site* in the already computed diagram where a new *site* would fall if
it were a regular point - is described very synthetically altough it's a
key passage to ensure the complexity constraints of the algorithm (`n
log(n)`, by the way).

Also, there's something *super-confusing* in the algorithm's
description: a sequence of regions (actually, sites) and dividing lines
is said to be ordered by the x dimension, and yet it can have the
following arrangement:

~~~~
R* of A   C(BA)-   R* of B   C(BA)+   R* of A
~~~~

How on earth this is ordered by the x coordinate is beyond me only by
the description in the algorithm. It turns out to be true, of course:
just look at the following picture and concentrate *only on the
hyperbola arcs* (which can be, indeed, be ordered by the x coordinate).

## What Fortune Implemented

After having looked at the paper, a look at the implementation was
due... and another problem popped up. Fortune's page at the Bell Labs
has disappeared, probably due to some restructuring of their website,
and it's somehow difficult to find the code. Luckily I found it in two
places:

- one in [Netlib's page on Voronoi diagrams][netlib-voronoi]
- one in [Archive.org's mirror of Fortune's homepage at Bell
Labs][sjf-archive-org]

The code is... enjoyable, although a bit messy by my wishes.


## Wrap Up and Final Notes

This ends this first chapter of my quest to understand Voronoi diagrams,
how to implement them and how to use them. Lessons learned so far:

- what is dubbed as Fortune's algorithm is most probably not from Steven
Fortune, although it probably started from there (if anything, Fortune
has the merit of showing that a sweepline apprach was possible)

- Wikipedia's page on the algorithm is, at best, a total mess

More to come!

Some final remarks:

- the [original article][fortune-springer] was published in 1987 in
  Algorithmica and is apparently behind a paywall today. I found copies
  of the article in some universities' websites (e.g. [here][article-1]
  and [here][article-2]) and, to be honest, I don't know if they are
  legit because I don't know if universities are allowed to provide some
  articles as part of their teaching activity. I'll remove these links
  if they point to something unlawful, although it would be a shame
  considering how much people would need to really read that article in
  the first place!

- The implementation in [netlib][netlib-voronoi] is apparently different
  from [the one in Fortune's homepage][sjf-archive-org], although I only
  checked this with `diff` to be honest, so it might be only minor
  changes. I'm not even sure which of the two is the more updated one,
  so choose carefully if you want to reuse that code.
