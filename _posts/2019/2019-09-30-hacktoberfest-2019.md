I'm participating to [Hacktoberfest][] this year (2019), an initiative
by [Digital Ocean][do] based on Pull Requests submitted in [GitHub][]
during the month of October.

Looking at the rules, it seems that *any time zone* does the trick, so
this afternoon in the train I figured that somewhere eastern of Rome it
was *already* October. So I decided to give it a try.

It turns out that I took the risk to submit the required four Pull
Requests already:

If they are not marked as spam (and I don't expect them to be) it seems
that my Hacktoberfest is completed before October even arrives in Rome
ðŸ˜…

**Update** - it looks like I made it!
