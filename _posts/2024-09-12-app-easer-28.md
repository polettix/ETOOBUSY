**TL;DR**

> There's a new release of [App::Easer][]: 2.008.

Long time no see, huh?!? My last post here was *almost* e-l-e-v-e-n
months ago! `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

OK, back to [App::Easer][]. It was a long due release, after fixing many
bugs and annoyances that [djerius][] reported.

There's been new designing but in a backwards-compatible way, especially
in how `sources` can be handled in a new way. Check out the new [shiny
tutorial for v2.008][tutorial]!

Stay safe!
