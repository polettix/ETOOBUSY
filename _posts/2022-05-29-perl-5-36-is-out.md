**TL;DR**

> [Perl][] v5.36 is out and is very interesting.

In the last years I've become accostumed to `use v5.24` for several
reasons:

- it's the first to provide the `experimental::signatures` thing that I
  like to use in a shape that I hope it's become stable;
- it's reasonably widespread (that, or something appeared later), so I
  can use it and not worry;
- strictures are enabled by default.

I have to say that [Perl][] v5.36 is tickling me a lot. There's a couple
of things that might seem like minor stuff to others, but I think they
can be incredibly useful. Although yes, probably not that big deal!

From my first read of [perldelta][], this got my attention:

- [iteration n at a time][iterating]:

```perl
my @listy = qw<
    foo   bar   baz
    Foo   Bar   Baz
    fooey barry bazzy
>;
for my ($foo, $bar, $baz) (@listy) { ... }
```

This goes very well with the new [indexed][] stuff too:

```perl
use builtin 'indexed';
my @listy = qw< foo bar baz >; 
for my ($index, $val) (indexed @listy) { ... }
```

- [trim][]:

```perl
my $messy = '   this needs some\ntrimming  ';
my $tidy  = builtin::trim($messy);
```

This is mainly a matter of readability, I know I could also do:

```perl
my $messy = '   this needs some\ntrimming  ';
my $tidy  = $messy =~ s{\A\s+|\s+\z}{}rmxs;
```

Readability is important though!

- [defer blocks][]: this lets us define *guards* without resorting to
  tricks, which is amazing:

```perl
use feature 'defer';
 
sub whatever {
    say "This happens first";
    defer { say "This happens last"; }
    say "And this happens inbetween";
    return;
    defer { say "Nothing, this is not printed" }
}

whatever();
```

Prints:

```
This happens first
And this happens inbetween
This happens last
```

So... I'll probably give it a try!

Stay safe folks!
