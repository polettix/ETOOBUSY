**TL;DR**

> I put the [Ticket to Write][] repository online.

You might remember that I was playing with the idea of a
*roll-and-write* game inspired to the venerable [Ticket to Ride][] and,
in particular, heavily inspired to [Ticket to Ride London][].

I wanted to see it at a playable level and... it is! I put all the stuff
in the [Ticket to Write][] online repository.

If you're interested into print-and-play ready stuff, head to the
[package registry][], where you can e.g. find the first
[ttw-london.pdf][].

Please provide feedback if you have... and until next time, stay safe!
