**TL;DR**

> I know no trick to guarantee [eventual consistency in coding][ec].

I started coding a solitaire game some time ago, with its bag of
overengineering and being diverted to other directions etc.

You know, the usual stuff.

Then, of course, I arrived at the point of re-writing this and re-shaping
that because otherwise bad things might happen in a parallel universe, and
then of course life called and the project was abandoned for a bit.

I mean, two or three weeks.

Coming back to the project, I sort of remember that I was in the middle of
something (pieces are lying all around, it would be difficult to miss it)
and I also sort of remember what I was doing, but looking at it I'm finding
the whole thing both overcomplicated (*surprise!*) and probably best
addressed starting over again.

What bothers me is that I already had tests for some of the moving parts.

Well, this is life... stay safe folks!
