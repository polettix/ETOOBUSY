**TL;DR**

> I found an interesting article: [Why Perl?][].

And it seems that I should not have been able to find it, as its publication
date is `2023-05-26`, i.e. slightly less than four weeks from now.

The case for using [Perl][] (i.e. rapid prototyping of solutions that
usually exceed their expected time span) is surely compelling. There seems
to be a comment with the usual trope about readability, but as of 2023 I
think that the burden of proof is on the critics' side, not [Perl][]'s.

Anyway. As for me, I use [Perl][] because it's lovely, quick, general and
reasonably reasonable. Plus it's very fun, which is key for an amateur.

The whole blog seems very interesting too, so I'll surely be looking at more
posts. You might want to do that too... *future me*.

Cheers!
