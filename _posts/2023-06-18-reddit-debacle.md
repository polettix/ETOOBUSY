**TL;DR**

> Reddit is apparently falling apart.

I sometimes lurk around in Reddit, although not too much. Many times it pops
out with answers to questions I ask to search engines.

Then, of course, there are kitten photos.

They lately decided to introduce a change where they're going to charge for
API usage. They're trying to make it pass like a move for bare survival, but
the cost and the little time they're giving to adapt to these changes are
actually a move to oust third-party apps (which people love) and re-gain
dominance of people's eyeballs, I guess mostly for advertising reasons.

Nothing really new under the sun: a private platform in Internet is trying
to *monetize*, and the community (/communities) that use that platform are
having a cold shower.

I can't predict what will happen, although one thing I understand is that
*most* if not *all* of the content on the platform is totally contributed. I
mean, Reddit is actually only providing the platform: important, sure, but
is it enough to win this arm wrestling?

This reminded me of [*secession plebis*][Secession plebis], i.e. the
secession of the people; while patricians initially thought they would have
the upper hand, they eventually had to concede the creation of a new
representative figure for... people.

Here, probably, many people will be held hostage by some *either us, or no
community*. I don't know, time will tell. My solidarity goes to the
redditors/moderators, but this should be yet another reminder that [leaning
too much over a private, commercial service is subject to these kind of
sudden changes][kbg].

Cheers!
