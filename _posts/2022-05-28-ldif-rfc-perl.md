**TL;DR**

> [Perl][] appears in [RFC 2849 - The LDAP Data Interchange Format
> (LDIF) - Technical Specification][RFC]

This might be considered some flavour of *s\*htposting* of course, but I
had a truly busy day and this caught my attention:

> A fairly simple set of tools written in awk or perl can, for example,
> convert a database of personnel information into an LDIF file.

I'll not nitpick on [Perl][] over `perl` and just appreciate how
*normal* it was to talk about it for getting a job done. Which is still
the case for me 22 years after, by the way.

Stay safe folks!
