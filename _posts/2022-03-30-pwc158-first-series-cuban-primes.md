# The questions

Where's the trick? I feel I'm missing something important here.


# The solution

I could think of two ways to address this challenge:

- go through prime numbers up to 1000 and find out those that are also
  of the form $3y^2 + 3y + 1$, **OR**
- generate all numbers of the form $3y^2 + 3y + 1$ up to 1000, and find
  out those that are also primes.

Eventually I settled for the latter, because generating the numbers is
easier than finding the integer solutions to the quadratic eqution, and
the test for primality is readily available in [ntheory][].

So let's start with [Perl][]:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl
use v5.24;
use FindBin '$Bin';
use lib "$Bin/local/lib/perl5";
use ntheory 'is_prime';

my $M = shift // 1000;
my @cubans;
my $y = 1;
while ((my $p = 3 * $y * ($y + 1) + 1) <= $M) {
   push @cubans, $p if is_prime($p);
   ++$y;
}
say join(', ', @cubans), '.';
```

I'm not entirely happy with this solution, it feels... *clunky*. Like
collecting the stuff in array `@cubans`, I don't know.

The [Raku][] counterpart allows me to use one of my favorite constructs,
i.e. `gather`/`take`:

```raku
#!/usr/bin/env raku
use v6;
sub MAIN (Int:D $M = 1000) {
   put gather {
      my $y = 1;
      while (my $p = 3 * $y * ($y + 1) + 1) <= $M {
         take $p if $p.is-prime;
         ++$y;
      }
   }.join(', '), '.';
}
```

I don't know why I'm so fond of `gather`/`take`, it just feels so
natural. Before you get spoiled too, though, keep in mind that I'be been
advised *against* it because of performance issues. This is one reson
why I like these challenges, I can play with the language without being
hit by it! ðŸ˜…

Stay safe!
