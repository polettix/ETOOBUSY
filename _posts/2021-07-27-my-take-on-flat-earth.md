**TL;DR**

> A view on the *flat earth* theory from an economic and social angle.

It's both depressing and amusing that flat earth theories got so much
attention in the past years. Probably talking about it does not help...
I'll just avoid putting links.

I mean, it's good to question things - but giving as *proof* that
*they're lying to us* should at least make you question yourself if
*you* are lying too. Whatever.

In 1997 I got a degree in Electronics Engineering, where I was not
exposed to anything related to communication satellites. You know, that
stuff that allows us, among other things, to watch satellite TV channels
and use Google Maps to go from A to B.

After 10 months of working in one company, I joined a small consulting
company that was led by a professor in the Telecommunications department
in my same university. Which meant that I had to study a lot of stuff
related to satellites, including the mechanics of orbits and how
satellites go there and *remain* there, how you have to continuously
tune their positions, etc.

This was the same stuff that all my colleagues had studied in their
years at the university, that their colleagus in the Telecommunications
course had studied, and that students of our professor were studying as
I was working. It's also the same stuff that they study today, by the
way.

That's a good lot of people. Some of them end up working for companies
that actually manufacture satellites and their control system, including
stabilizers for the satellite position. All under the assumption that
the satellite is going to go on a mostly elliptical orbit around a
roundish earth.

Now here's the catch. Let's consider that there is indeed a big lie
where a super-elite keeps telling us that the earth is round, while it's
actually flat. I mean, overall flat.

States and companies must spend *a lot* of money to keep the lie going,
consciously or not. They have to make sure that there's people teaching
that stuff at the university, that companies go on producing stuff that
works according to the lie and pay people to basically work on stuff
that is eventually thrown in the garbage bin because, well... it's based
on a lie and it's never going to work, right?

They're companies that work under market rules. So there must be *a lot*
of money that is spent only to keep the lie going. I guess Keynes would
be super-happy here!

At the same time, those services that *apparently* run thanks to
"round-earth satellites" must go on, right? I mean, a lot of people pay
for "satellite TV" and expect to *see something* on their television
sets, right? When you fire up Google Maps, you expect to see where you
are and be followed as you progress to where you're going, right?

This means that not only there must be a *different kind of physics* to
govern how this *alternative satellite system* works, but also that some
people have to be made aware of this so that they can indeed make the
machine go.

This also means that, along with the "lie-based" engineering
departments, there must also be "truth-based" engineering departments
somewhere, where they teach the real stuff to make sure that the lie
goes on unscathed! And also that people will have to attend those
courses, but not only them - also all courses on maths etc. because
otherwise it would be too easy for people attending a university to
figure that some course colleagues *disappear* from time to time, while
still giving the same exams. So at least an entire faculty of
Engineering is needed.

Not only this: there must also be companies that actually produce the
*true* stuff and make sure that it goes on. Where the *real initiated
engineers* go to work every day and from where they return every
evening.

All over the world, by the way. Try to figure out *how many people*
would be needed to do this.

All of this, apparently, without getting a dime back - I'd like to see a
broadcaster that is told that they have to pay for the *fake* satellite
system **and** the real one, all under the tight condition that nobody
can speak about it *at all costs*.

Hence, I think, you don't have to go to the beach and see a big boat
disappear at the horizon to convince yourself that the Earth's positive
curvature is a thing. You can just *think* about this in the comfort of
your favourte chair, possibly while watching a movie from a "satellite
channel" while scanning your mobile phone for the best route to go
buying snacks (to better enjoy the movie).

And maybe, at that point, you can move on to the next conspiration
theory, because this is really *too much*.
