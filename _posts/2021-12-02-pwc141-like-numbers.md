**TL;DR**

> On with [TASK #2][] from [The Weekly Challenge][] [#141][].
> Enjoy!

# The challenge

> You are given positive integers, `$m` and `$n`.
>
> Write a script to find total count of integers created using the
> digits of `$m` which is also divisible by `$n`.
>
> Repeating of digits are not allowed. Order/Sequence of digits canâ€™t be
> altered. You are only allowed to use (n-1) digits at the most. For
> example, 432 is not acceptable integer created using the digits of

# The questions

It's not entirely clear to me what would happen with a number having
repeated digits *inside*. Let's take `1223` as an example: the
sub-sequence `123` can be generated in two ways, i.e. `12 3` and `1 23`.
Do they count as two different ones? I'll assume yes, definitely yes!

# The solution

To generate all possible sequences, we'll associate a bit to each
position in the input `$m`. If the bit is `0`, the digit will be
ignored; otherwise, it will be taken. At this point, it will be
sufficient to count from 1 up to $2^k - 2$, where $k$ is the number of
bits (we subtract 2 because we can take up to $k - 1$ bits by
requirement).

So, let's start with [Perl][] this time:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl
use v5.24;
use warnings;
use experimental 'signatures';
no warnings 'experimental::signatures';

sub like_numbers ($m = 1234, $n = 2) {
   my @m = split m{}mxs, $m;
   my $bits = @m;
   my $N = 2 ** $bits - 2;
   my $c = 0;
   for my $i (1 .. $N) {
      my @b = split m{}mxs, sprintf "%0${bits}b", $i;
      my $v = join '', map { $b[$_] ? $m[$_] : () } 0 .. $#m;
      ++$c unless $v % $n;
   }
   return $c;
}

say like_numbers(@ARGV);
```

We count, we generate the bit sequences in `@b` and then select the
corresponding digits in `@m`... like we said before.

Let's move on to [Raku][] now:

```raku
#!/usr/bin/env raku
use v6;

sub MAIN (Int:D $m = 1234, Int:D $n = 2) {
   like-numbers($m, $n).put;
}

sub like-numbers (Str() $m, Int:D $n) {
   my @m = $m.comb(/\d/);
   my $bits = @m.elems;
   my $template = '%0' ~ $bits ~ 'b';
   my $N= 2 ** $bits - 1;
   my $c = 0;
   for 0 ^..^ $N -> $i {
      my @b = $template.sprintf($i).comb(/<[0 1]>/);
      my $v = (0 .. @m.end).map({ @b[$_] > 0 ?? @m[$_] !! '' }).join('');
      ++$c if $v %% $n;
   }
   return $c;
}
```

It's a *perlish* translation - I suspect that some hyperoperator might
come to the rescue here, but I don't really know *which* ðŸ™„

OK, enough for this week... stay safe folks!
