**TL;DR**

> [This video][] from YouTuber [Ahoy][] is amazing.

I sometimes end my delirant ramblings here with *have fun!* or something
like this.

[This video][] is one of the most perfect interpretations of having fun.
[Ahoy][] re-creates a digital image from the eighties starting from a photo,
because the digital version is lost for good. I can only wonder how much
time it took to do that, while collecting pieces on the way to produce an
amazing video with the usual amazing comment.

Kudos!
