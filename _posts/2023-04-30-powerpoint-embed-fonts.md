**TL;DR**

> Something I look for from time to time.

It's nice when we find a nice font for using in a presentation. It's a
little less nice when we share this presentation and it looks a mess, just
because the font is not available in the *other* system.

It's possible to embed the font in the saved file, so that everything will
travel in the same package and be available everywhere.

> It's only possible to embed TrueType (TTF) and OpenType (OTF) fonts.

The gist of it is (with a recent version of PowerPoint):

- `File` (top-left)
- `Options` (near the bottom of the list)
- `Save` (near the top of the list)
- `Embed fonts in the file` (in section `Font Embedding`)

I usually don't mind too much getting a big file, so I stick with embedding
the whole font. You never know if some last-minute changes will be needed,
so better safe than sorry.

Cheers!
