**TL;DR**

> [Challenge 25][] in [Cryptopals][].

This challenge puzzled me a bit. I guess that the point is that CTR mode
makes sense *if and only if* the *nonce* is changed and not reused. In
this case there's no mentioning of it and it *seems* like the nonce is
always the same, because we should be able to do the editing *in-place*.

If this is the case, then I might have *cheated a bit* with the `edit`
function, because it's not selective but it re-encrypts everything all
the time.

Why this? Simply because we don't need to do anything fancy:

- we can provide a ciphertext
- we can provide a substitute for the plaintext at the offset we want

So we're in a chosen plaintext and ciphertext attack situation here,
with encryption done with simple XORing with a very long key which will
be kept always the same. Not very secure...

Instead of implementing strange algorithms, we're going to substitute
the *whole* plaintext with all zeroes, so that the result will be... the
key. This is the power of XOR!

```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl
use v5.24;
use warnings;
use experimental 'signatures';
no warnings 'experimental::signatures';

use CryptoPals qw< ctr_mode_encrypt block_encrypter random_octets
   slurp_base64 aes_ecb_decrypt
>;

my $ecb_ciphertext = slurp_base64(shift // '25.txt');
my $ecb_key = 'YELLOW SUBMARINE';
my $plaintext = aes_ecb_decrypt($ecb_ciphertext, $ecb_key);

# Here comes the attacker!
my $ciphertext = dencrypt($plaintext);
my $zeroooooos = "\x00" x length $ciphertext;
my $super_key  = edit_API($ciphertext, 0, $zeroooooos);
say $ciphertext ^ $super_key;

sub dencrypt ($data) {
   state $ctr_key = random_octets(16);
   state $encrypter = block_encrypter($ctr_key);
   state $ctr_nonce = random_octets(8);
   ctr_mode_encrypt($encrypter, $ctr_nonce, $data);
}

sub edit_API ($ciphertext, $offset, $newtext) {
   my $plaintext = dencrypt($ciphertext);
   substr $ciphertext, $offset, length($newtext), $newtext;
   return dencrypt($ciphertext);
}
```

I did probably miss the point of the whole challenge.

Stay safe *and secure*!
