**TL;DR**

> [PDF::Collage][] is on [CPAN][].

It's a little module with a very limited functionality, the basic one
enabling to take pages from a PDF, glue some text over it and save as a
new PDF. Its main purpose is to support using these PDFs as templates
for dynamic filling at a later stage.

It comes with [pdf-collage][], a program to use the templating
capabilities from the command line.

I hope you can find it useful... stay safe!
