**TL;DR**

> I have to port many tests before releasing [App::Easer][] V2.

I ported another application to [App::Easer][] V2 (the version that is
on GitHub for the moment) and I'm quite pleased with the results. There
were a few of rough edge but overall it's been a pleasure (and a trove
of feedback).

The current status is that only a few of the basic tests have been
ported... so I'll have to port the other ones, as well as adding new
ones. This intrigues me... because it's using the module at its core,
but it also scares me a lot (what will come out?!?).

So... there's a lot of testing ahead for me!
