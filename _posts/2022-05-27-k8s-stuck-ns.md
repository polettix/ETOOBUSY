**TL;DR**

> TIL how to delete a "stubborn" namespace in [Kubernetes][].

The thing was simple: a `kubectl delete namespace my-ns` was stuck.

I'm not sure *why* in that particular cluster and setup, but still.

Looking around I found a way: a `finalizer` was waiting for something
that was not happening, and was not going to happen either. So the
solution was straightforward: get rid of that finalizer. Except that
it's *not a solution*. I mean, it unhangs the namespace and removes it,
but it might leave behind stuff that might bite us eventually.

There is [one interesting thread][] about this. The long way is thus to
find all resources that prevent the namespace from being removed, and
remove them *gently*.

Cheers!
