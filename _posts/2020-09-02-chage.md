**TL;DR**

> Don't give for granted that you will be able to login tomorrow.

Some friends were biten a not-so-nice issue recently: all of a sudden
they were not able to log into some virtual machines, because the remote
system insisted on asking for a password change.

Too bad that they were accessing via SSH keys and did not know the
password.

This is how I learned that [chage][] can tell me if I'm risking the
same:

```shell
$ chage -l "$USER"
Last password change                                : Aug 01, 2018
Password expires                                    : never
Password inactive                                   : never
Account expires                                     : never
Minimum number of days between password change      : 0
Maximum number of days between password change      : 99999
Number of days of warning before password expires   : 7
```

This is pretty good for my account on my private virtual machine. You
mileage may vary according to the policies you set or are subject to -
whatever the case, it's better to check if you will be able to login
tomorrow!
