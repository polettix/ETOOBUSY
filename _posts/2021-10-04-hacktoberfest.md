**TL;DR**

> [Hacktoberfest][] 2021 started!

Which is why I waited for proposing a pull-request to [Path::Tiny][] a
few days ago ðŸ™„

Anyway, thanks to the exceptional [manwar][] and [The Weekly
Challenge][] it seems that one pull-request is already underway, and a
few others are on their way too.

In particular, I've filed a pull-request for doing a bit of housekeeping
in [AllAlgorithms][], another one for adding an implementation of the
area of polygon in [AllAlgorithms/perl][] and there's another one to add
the links to this new implementation and the area of triangle as well.

Let's see how it goes and... stay safe in the meantime!
