**TL;DR**

> I'll probably take a look at [LaTeX][] after some years.

I'm pretty happy with how [PDF::Collage][] is behaving where I'm using it,
although I sometimes need to tweak the text in the basic templates a bit.

At this point, I have to go back to the document preparation system that I
used to generate the PDF templates in the first place (it's a popular and
closed source document editor), do the tweaking and so forth, just to end up
thinking that I could have just as well produced the final PDF directly from
there. I mean, the final result I was aiming to.

So, of course, my brain went into yet-another-loop where I think that it
should be different, probably SVG would work better, what do I really know,
how can it be that I can't just use HTML with some specific CSS aimed at
printing, etc. etc. only to find out that I don't know *anything* about the
topic and I will probably not know about it for the rest of my life.

When these loops go full circle, I usually also think about [LaTeX][], of
course. I'm probably *just* scared about the amount of time that would take
me to arrive to the *almost perfect* template, but at that point my worries
would probably be solved. And I would have something very easy to tweak from
my beloved command line.

Cheers!
