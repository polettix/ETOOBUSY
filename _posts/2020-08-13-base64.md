**TL;DR**

From [Base64][]:

So... what to do about it? Usually, Linux distributions have a utility
for it: [base64][].

Using [base64][] is straightforward, as it can act as a filter:

```shell
$ printf 'whatevah!' | base64
d2hhdGV2YWgh
```

Note that it encodes *everything* you give it as input, even a newline.
This can introduce infuriating bugs when encoding username and passwords
for Basic Authentication, so it's better to use `printf` *without* a
newline, like in the example above or the following:

```shell
$ printf '%s:%s' "$username" "$password" | base64
...
```

Decoding is easy with the `-d` option:

```
$ printf 'd2hhdGV2YWgh' | base64 -d ; echo
whatevah!
```

The final `; echo` makes sure that the prompt is printed on a newline...
because we did not include one in the encoded string, as described
above.

Happy [Base64][] encoding!
