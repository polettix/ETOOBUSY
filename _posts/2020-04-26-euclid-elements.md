**TL;DR**

Without further ado:

[The First Six Books of The Elements of Euclid With Coloured Diagrams
and Symbols][byrne]

# What is this about?

The site has it:

> A reproduction of Oliver Byrneâ€™s celebrated work from 1847 plus

# Is it easy?

Well... yes and no. If you're used to math symbolism (as I assume to
be), you'll have to *re-learn* it in favor of shapes and colors.

One thing that puzzled me a bit was the Pythagora's Theorem
demonstration (i.e. [Proposition XLVII][prop-47]), when it says that the
area of the red square is twice the area of a specific triangle - the
following picture shows it:

![Step I stumbled on in Pythagoras's theorem demonstration]({{ '/assets/images/pythagoras-byrne.png' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})

After sweating a bit, and looking in Google, it was clear that the
square and the triangle share both the same base and the same height,
hence their areas's ratio must be two.

# So long!

What to say more? Go take a look, it's amazing! Be sure to click on the
pictures in the demonstrations, they will highlight stuff in the
pictures on the side (where it makes sense), making it awesomely
comfortable to follow.
