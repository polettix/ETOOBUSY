**TL;DR**

> Let's share [fail2ban2geo][], for fun.

In [GeoIP database from MaxMind][] I was a bit *hand-wavy* by only
giving credits to the tools/data I used without showing any code.

Well, [here it is][], even with some help!

Installing it can be done with the help of [Installing Perl Modules][],
thanks to the `cpanfile`. The help is available by running sub-command
`help`:

```
$ ./fail2ban2geo help
map IPs from Fail2ban to Country names

Description:
    This program takes the output of:
    
       fail2ban-client status fail2ban
    
    and extracts the list of blocked IPs, then queries them from a local
    copy of GeoIP data to see what countries the source IPs were from.
    
    So yes, this can give us an idea of who is trying to brute force
    into a server.
    
    Option `--input`/`-i` allows setting the input. By default it's from
    STDIN, which is also the case if it set to the string '-'. If the
    argument starts with a colon, it's assumed to be the name of a jail
    managed by Fail2ban and used to call the command (if the needed jail
    is `XXX`):
    
       fail2ban-client status XXX
    
    Option `--fail2ban` allows setting the executable for
    `fail2ban-client`, in case it's named differently or not available
    in `PATH`. Option `--sudo` allows calling it with `sudo`.
    
    The translation from an IP address to the country name is performed
    thanks to the Perl module `IP::Geolocation::MMDB`, which leverages a
    DB File in MaxMind format available for free from MaxMind, see:
    
       https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data
    
    It's possible to point to the local copy of the database file
    through option `--dbpath` or its aliases.
    
    The output is usually sorted from the most frequent down to the
    least one. Option `--ascending` and its aliases allow reverting
    this.

Options:
      ascending: sort in ascending order (most frequent last)
                 command-line: boolean option
                               --ascending | --no-ascending
                               --asc | --no-asc
                               -a
                  environment: F2B2G_SORT_ASCENDING
                      default: 0

         dbpath: path to a MaxMind-compatible db file
                 command-line: mandatory string option
                               --dbpath <value>
                               --db <value>
                               -d <value>
                  environment: F2B2G_DBPATH
                      default: /path/to/find2bin2geo/local/city.mmdb

       fail2ban: command to run for fail2ban
                 command-line: mandatory string option
                               --fail2ban <value>
                  environment: F2B2G_FAIL2BAN
                      default: fail2ban-client

          input: where to get the input (- => stdin, :XXX => jail XXX)
                 command-line: mandatory string option
                               --input <value>
                               -i <value>
                  environment: F2B2G_INPUT
                      default: -

           sudo: run with sudo
                 command-line: boolean option
                               --sudo | --no-sudo
                  environment: F2B2G_SUDO
                      default: 0

Sub-commands:
           help: print a help command
       commands: list sub-commands
```
