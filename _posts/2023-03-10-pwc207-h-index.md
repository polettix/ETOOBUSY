# The challenge

> You are given an array of integers containing citations a researcher has

> Write a script to compute the researcher’s `H-Index`. For more information

# The questions

No questions asked, as the domain makes it pretty clear that we're talking
"human" numbers, both in terms of size of the input array, as well as each
individual count of citations.

# The solution

The text/definition steals us the joy of coming up with a solution, because
it hints about having the array sorteded in *descending* order.

In fact, the key is that we have to compare a *count* of elements in a
subset with the values in the subsets. If we start with an array sorted like
above, as we move on we progressively include articles with *less*
citations, while at the same time increasing the size of the subset. At this
point, it's just a matter of meeting in the middle.

Let's go [Perl][] first:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl
use v5.24;
use warnings;
use experimental 'signatures';

say h_index(@ARGV);

sub h_index (@citations) {
   @citations = reverse sort { $a <=> $b } grep { $_ } @citations;
   $_ < $citations[$_] || return $_ for 0 .. $#citations;
   return scalar(@citations);
}
```

We're removing articles with *no* citations at all, because they're pretty
much useless to calculate the H-Index. Then we sort and reverse, to get our
descending list of counts.

Then we iterate through the whole array. If we find a crossing point, then
we can return; otherwise, *every* article is part of the H-Index, so we just
return the size of the subset of articles with at least one citation.

[Raku][] goes pretty much the same way, making the first preparatory part a
bit more readable for many westerners (at least those who are used to
reading left-to-right):

```raku
#!/usr/bin/env raku
use v6;
sub MAIN (*@args) { put h-index(@args) }

sub h-index (@citations) {
   @citations = @citations».Int.grep({.so}).sort.reverse;
   $_ < @citations[$_] || return $_ for ^@citations;
   return @citations.elems;
}
```

Stay safe folks!
