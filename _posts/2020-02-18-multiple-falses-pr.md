**TL;DR**

> Where I tell you about the pull request to distinguish between two
> different *false* values in [Text::Gitignore][].

Previous post [Unmatched is not Excluded][] contains a few suggestions for
extending [Text::Gitignore][] so that *false* values returned by the
*matcher functions* (as generated by `build_gitignore_matcher`) also convey
the additional information that:

- the input path failed to match every non-negated pattern, i.e. it is
  ignored by the current rules. In this case, `undef` is returned, to
  signify that nothing was hit for this item, OR

- the input path was excluded because of a negated pattern. In this case, a
  *false* but *defined* value is returned.

The following examples should help better framing the explanation above:

```
my $matcher  = build_gitignore_matcher(['f*', '!foo*', 'foobar']);
my $matched  = $matcher->('foobar');  # $matched set to true
my $ignored  = $matcher->('bar');     # $ignored set to undef
my $excluded = $matcher->('foolish'); # $excluded set to false but defined (e.g. 0)
```

This ended up in the [Pull Request][]... fingers crossed!
