**TL;DR**

> The social construct of a "year".

Yesterday I was thinking about the "year" and how it's totally a social
construct. We live on this planet that goes around this star, and from
time to time it regularly more-or-less finds itself in the same relative
spot; then we call it a year. Another year.

> If it looks cryptic... well, it is.

Incidentally, I was also thinking about a 5-days week would work about 3
years out of 4 to evenly divide the number of days in one year. Then it
would come the leap year, of course.

Cheers!
