**TL;DR**

> An interesting article on [tech debt][].

I can't really sum the article up because I fear I would be lacking 80% of
the important parts and misrepresenting the other 80%.

Well, you get the idea, *right?!?*

Just for future me, who will maybe smile at me but not be too harsh anyway:

- The metaphor works only if you really understand *debt* is a tool and, as
  any tool, can be used for good (/profitable) reasons or to be seriously
  wounded.

- Going down to 0 debt is most probably a waste of resources, much like
  [premature optimization is the root of all evils][roae].

- Your gut feeling is anyway right: we're paying too little tech debt and
  this does not help at many levels.

I hope you will enjoy the article as much as I did!
