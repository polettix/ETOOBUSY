**TL;DR**

> Here we are with [TASK #1][] from [The Weekly Challenge][]
> [#182][]. Enjoy!

# The challenge

> You are given a list of integers.
>
> Write a script to find the index of the first biggest number in the
> list.
>
> **Example**
>
>     Input: @n = (5, 2, 9, 1, 7, 6)
>     Output: 2 (as 3rd element in the list is the biggest number)
>
>     Input: @n = (4, 2, 3, 1, 5, 0)
>     Output: 4 (as 5th element in the list is the biggest number)

# The questions

Many people might remember that around here it was all countryside and
[Perl][] was the main benevolent owner, together with sister [Raku][].

Then came other languages, the host deemed it good and the whole thing
became more inclusive: from *The **Perl** Weekly Challenge* it became
*The Weekly Challenge*.

Which, at this point, *officially* includes [Pascal][], right? So what's
the *index* supposed to start from? It's a bit vague! ðŸ™„

Anyway, I'll code in [Perl][] and [Raku][], so the indexes will
definitely start at 0.


# The solution

The idea is to prefer simplicity over efficiency. We generate a list of
all indexes, order this list based on the magnitude of the corresponding
item (ascendingly), then take the last element.

```raku
#!/usr/bin/env raku
use v6;
sub MAIN (*@args) {
   @args = 5, 2, 9, 1, 7, 6 unless @args;
   put max-index(@args);
}

sub max-index (@args) {
   (0 ..^ @args).sort(
      {
         @args[$^a] <=> @args[$^b] # sort by value, but if equal...
         || $^b <=> $a             # just be anti-stable
      }
   )[*-1] # then just take the last element
}
```

The attentive reader will have noticed by now that the condition is
slightly pickier than previously described. In case two values are the
same, the *bigger* index comes before the *smaller*. This makes sure
that the smaller one gets pushed to the end of the array, where we will
eventually collect it. To make a long story short, this works also in
case the maximum value is repeated in multiple positions in the input
array.

The [Perl][] translation is straightforward:


```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl
use v5.24;
use warnings;
use experimental 'signatures';
no warnings 'experimental::signatures';

my @args = @ARGV ? @ARGV : (5, 2, 9, 1, 7, 6, 9);
say max_index(@args);

sub max_index (@args) {
   return (
      sort {
         $args[$a] <=> $args[$b] # sort ascending, BUT...
         || $b <=> $a            # be anti-stable if equal
      } (0 .. $#args)
   )[-1];
}
```

Stay safe!
