**TL;DR**

> I shared [validns][], a small tool for DNS validation.

I wanted to do some validation upon a few domains lately, and it was an
excellent occasion to use module [Net::DNS][]. The result for what I coded
so far is shared in repository [validns][].

At the moment it does the following checks:

- get the list of authoritative nameservers starting from the root;
- check that the same list is also stored in each of these nameservers;
- check that all of them share the same SOA field.

I actually coded something to get WHOIS data about the domains, leveraging
the free tier in the [whoisjson.com][] web service. This part will probably
be added to optionally check the nameservers against what's written in the
WHOIS database, e.g. checking whether there's an available API key or not.

I hope somebody will read this and give me hints about a ready-made tool (no
online stuff please!), I tried to look for something but with no luck.

Stay safe and validated!
