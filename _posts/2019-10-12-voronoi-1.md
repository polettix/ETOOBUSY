Voronoi diagrams started fascinating me a couple years ago... and I'm still
trying hard to grasp how to manage them properly!

## Where It Started

As it often happens, it all started playing.

This time I was playing by solving programming problems in
[CodingGame][], which I strongly recommend by the way (if you like
programming of course). Some puzzle might require to get the nearest
location where there is *something*, and this is where [Voronoi
diagrams][voronoi-wikipedia] usually pop up.

In a nutshell in 2D, given some fixed *sites* (e.g. where your possible
targets are located), the Voronoi diagram represents how the plane can
be divided so that each *site* is surrounded by a *region* of points
that are closer to that *site* more than every other. Or:
