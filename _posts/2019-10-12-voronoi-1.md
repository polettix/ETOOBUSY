Voronoi diagrams started fascinating me a couple years ago... and I'm still
trying hard to grasp how to manage them properly!

## Where It Started

As it often happens, it all started playing.

This time I was playing by solving programming problems in
[CodingGame][], which I strongly recommend by the way (if you like
programming of course). Some puzzle might require to get the nearest
location where there is *something*, and this is where [Voronoi
diagrams][voronoi-wikipedia] usually pop up.

In a nutshell in 2D, given some fixed *sites* (e.g. where your possible
targets are located), the Voronoi diagram represents how the plane can
be divided so that each *site* is surrounded by a *region* of points
that are closer to that *site* more than every other. Something like
this:

![vononoi-wikipedia-png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Euclidean_Voronoi_diagram.svg/500px-Euclidean_Voronoi_diagram.svg.png)

so, for example, any point in the gray area in the low-left corner is
closer to the black dot inside that are than - say - the black dot
inside the pink area immediately above on the left border.


## ... Now I Have Two Problems

It turns out I never really used Voronoi diagrams in [CodingGame][], at
least not so far. Never say never. There are a couple of reasons:

- first of all, there's no pure-[Perl][] implementation that I could
find. Well, of course I could think of implementing it, but this led me
to the second reason...

- *using* the Voronoid tessellation is not exactly straightforward. Even
if I could land on a good description of all polygons associated to each
site (they are convex, by the way), I would *still* have to figure out
how to find the right polygon for the generic query point. There are of
course algorithms to do that (we'll get there, hopefully), but still.

Long story short, using Voronoi diagrams to get the closer *site*
efficiently actually involves two algorithms:

- one to compute the Voronoi diagram efficiently, and
- one to query the diagram with a generic poing, again efficiently.

It's a lot of work... and I didn't invest the time. Two years ago, at
least.


## Being Honest

To be very, very honest: if it were very easy to implement the first
algorithm, I would have probably done that already and proceeded to the
second. It turns out that getting the Voronoi tessellation right can be
quite tricky. This is being honest with my willpower.

But.

We have also to be honest with another fact: the most *famous* algorithm
around, one which I think that today is almost always used and
implemented, is a bit complicated and also... a mess to get info about.

I'm obviously talking about the algorithm by [Steven
Fortune][sjf-archive-org] described in article [A sweepline algorithm for
Voronoi diagrams][fortune-springer], published in 1987.

Or am I?!?


## Fortune's Algorithm Is Not What Most People Think

Taking a step back, I turned to [Wikiepedia's page on Fortune's
algorithm][fortune-wikipedia] to take a look at it. Please note: the
link is to an *hopefully obsolete* version of the page in Wikipedia,
more or less the one I read so far. And it's a mess.

Long story short:

- the algorithm **description** is about a *sweepline algorithm* that
eventually computes the Voronoi diagram. It uses *parabolas* cleverly
arranged in a *shoreline* to allow for using a sweepline algorithm, but
of course it's a description and something more formal can help;

- the algoritm **pseudocode** is about a *sweepline algorithm* that
eventually computes the Voronoi diagram, BUT... it has nothing to do
with the one in the description! As a matter of fact, it's a copy-paste
from article [An Efficient Implementation of Fortune’s Plane-Sweep
Algorithm for Voronoi Diagrams][wong-muller] by Kenny Wong and Hausi A.
Müller, which is inspired to the original algorithm described by
Fortune.

Practically all implementation and blogs I found around refer to the
shoreline/parabolas description and specifically indicate that as
Fortune's algorithm, which is confusing at its best because of the
algorithm's pseudocode. To add misunderstanding to confusion, the
picture associated to the description shows a sweep from left to right,
while the pseudocode is about a line that goes from bottom to top!

In these cases, I find it helpful to look directly at the original
source, i.e. Fortune's original article. I have to say that it's a
clever piece of maths (we will get to that shortly), but a few things
are pretty evident:

- the shoreline is nowhere to be found
- there's no parabola in it, but hyperbola instead!

So, arguably, a whole lot of people are referring to Fortune's algorithm
without having really bothered to read it. It took me some time to
digest this, I couldn't believe it.


## What Fortune Really Says

Fortune started from the consideration that using a sweepline algorithm
directly is not feasible because at the beginning of the operations only
sites' positions are known, but also intersections between segments
(a.k.a. *vertices*) are points of interest. Alas, most of the times a
*vertex*'s position can only be found *after* analyzing a *site* that is
*beyond* that *vertex*. If only there was a way...

Well, Fortune found a way. He designed a clever transformation of the
plane that makes it finally possible to use a *sweepline* (i.e. a line
that sweeps the plane only moving in one direction) to get a division of
the plane that, when counter-transformed, provides the Voronoi diagram.
This transformation is not *one-to-one* everywhere, but it is indeed
*one-to-one* where it's needed, i.e. on the Voronoi diagram.

Fortune's algorithm is described after a considerable amount of maths
that demonstrate the properties of the transformation condensed in the
previous paragraph. The algorithm is described in about half a page and
is, indeed, quite similar to the pseudocode of Wikipedia's page,
although it at least takes the time to describe all symbols. Thanks!

From my limited capabilities, though, I'd say that the algorithm in the
original paper is not really straighforward. One key part - finding the
*site* in the already computed diagram where a new *site* would fall if
it were a regular point - is described very synthetically altough it's a
key passage to ensure the complexity constraints of the algorithm (`n
log(n)`, by the way).

Also, there's something *super-confusing* in the algorithm's
description: a sequence of regions (actually, sites) and dividing lines
is said to be ordered by the x dimension, and yet it can have the
following arrangement:

    siteA branchBA- siteB branchCB- siteC branchCB+ siteB branchBA+ siteA

How on earth this is ordered by the x coordinate is beyond me only by
the description in the algorithm.


## What Fortune Implemented

After having looked at the paper, a look at the implementation was
due... and another problem popped up. Fortune's page at the Bell Labs
has disappeared, probably due to some restructuring of their website,
and it's somehow difficult to find the code. Luckily I found it in two
places:

- one in [Netlib's page on Voronoi diagrams][netlib-voronoi]
- one in [Archive.org's mirror of Fortune's homepage at Bell
Labs][sjf-archive-org]

The code is... enjoyable, although a bit messy by my wishes.


## Wrap Up!

This ends this first chapter of my quest to understand Voronoi diagrams,
how to implement them and how to use them. Lessons learned so far:

- what is dubbed as Fortune's algorithm is most probably not from Steven
Fortune, although it probably started from there (if anything, Fortune
has the merit of showing that a sweepline apprach was possible)

- Wikipedia's page on the algorithm is, at best, a total mess

More to come!
