**TL;DR**

> I made some origami dice for [Tiny Epic Galaxies][].


[Tiny Epic Galaxies][] is a game from 2015 which, as I understand, started
as a print-and-play experiment ([still available][teg-pnp]) and was later
published in a somewhat expanded version. It seems an interesting craft.

One of the components are seven dice with custom faces. This is exactly what
[origalea][] is about for letting me craft the dice as origamis, although I
decided to use better icons instead of the very basic symbols in the
official free version.

So I headed over to [game-icons.net][] and selected six icons for the dice:

- [Bottled bolt][] by [Lorc][] under [CC-BY 3.0][].
- [Chart][] by [Delapouite][] under [CC-BY 3.0][]. 
- [Classical knowledge][] by [Delapouite][] under [CC-BY 3.0][]. 
- [Habitat dome][] by [Delapouite][] under [CC-BY 3.0][]. 
- [Rocket flight][] by [Lorc][] under [CC-BY 3.0][].
- [Three friends][] by [Delapouite][] under [CC-BY 3.0][]. 

The end result is in [this pdf][], if you're interested, which is [CC-BY
3.0][] by [polettix][].

They take a little time to fold and assemble, but you get used (instructions
linked from [origalea][]). As an added bonus, there's one additional die, so
it's possible to ditch the worse of the lot!

Happy folding!
