**TL;DR**

> [Advent of Code][] [2022][] is coming...

... and I'm late already.

I mean, as I write *right now* there's still 80+ hours to go until the
start of the [2022][] edition, *but* it reminded me that I still have to
go about 21 half-puzzles from 2018 and the full range of 49 half-puzzles
from 2019.

I'm also late because...

- ... last year I had some kind of *system* for streamlining puzzle
  resolution, but I still have a refresher, or look for improvement
  niches.
- ... I still have to update the blogging template. No big deal.
- ... I still have to figure out how to solve these puzzles. Last year
  was a fun experiment to use [Raku][], so I might do it again this
  year, with a nice fallback to [Perl][] when the pressure is really
  high and the time ticks.

If you're participating... I wish you to solve all your puzzles and have
fun doing it!
