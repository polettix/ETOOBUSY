**TL;DR**

> I was lucky to attend the [Pearl Jam][] concert in Imola.

A little deviation from the tech topics in this blog, I've been to the
[Pearl Jam][] concert in Imola on Saturday 25th.

It's been exciting to go to a concert again after waiting for two years.

The concert was interrupted a couple of times (one in the mid of a song)
for concerns about the safety of people attending the concert. It didn't
take anything from the concert, on the contrary **it added so much**.
