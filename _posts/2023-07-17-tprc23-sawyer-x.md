**TL;DR**

> Two interesting talks.

I'm looking at some of (some of) the [talks from The Perl and Raku
Conference 2023][tprc23] and I stumbled upon two of them by [Sawyer X][]:

- [No One is Immune to Abuse - Sawyer X - TPRC 2023][talk1]
- [The Perl 7 Retrospective: the Promise, the Fight, the Loss - Sawyer X - TPRC 2023][talk2]

They are *very* interesting and I truly admire the style. Being from one
person, they probably bring a biased view, but there's so many good points
that are just good *per-se* and applicable to whatever party.

One part that I liked a lot was the afterthought on how he dealt with one
particular insult email. The email was terrible, I don't know if written out
of frustration, need to channel anger or just mental illness. The fact that
he is capable of looking at his answer and decide that it was not the best
one to give is revolutionary.

I hope I'll be able to think about my interactions in the future not
necessarily in terms of who won and who lost, but realizing that if someone
lost it was probably the two of us. Possibly before that happens.

If you need a summary: two videos that are well worth the time if you don't
live under a rock alone, or live there but plan to return to society at any
time.

Cheers!
