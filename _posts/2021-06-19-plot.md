**TL;DR**

> A nice terminal tool: [plot][].

Recently I discovered a nice tool to plot sequences of data... on the terminal.
It's called [plot][].

Here's a run of the example - the traffic that is shown in the plot is the
result of a few HTTP requests:

<script id="asciicast-421164" src="https://asciinema.org/a/421164.js" async></script>

If the animation above is not smooth, it's probably something to do with the
recording because the "original" run was quite smooth indeed.

Just for fun, I did a static build of the code using the [musl libc][musl], you
can find it in the [local copy here][].

Happy plotting!
