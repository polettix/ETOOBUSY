**TL;DR**

> I eventually took a pause from blogging.

It eventually happened: I took a small pause from blogging. Only three days
actually, but it was a real challenge.

I mean, I had 3+ years of getting something published every day, which was a
little goal by itself but had started to become a burden lately, in the
sense that it was not any more a nudge to write, but something that I had to
do just to not interrupt the sequence.

So the feat was to interrupt the sequence, and it's not been easy. Being on
the other side of it, though, it's been refreshing. My [sand mandala][], if
you will.

In the meantime, I've gone a bit ahead and shared [Games-XLII][] on
Codeberg. It's my attempt at implementing the game mechanics of [Friday][],
with a different theme (i.e. running, hence the name XLII which is 42 in
roman numerals, like the number of kilometers in a Marathon).

As a matter of fact, the implementation per-se is not even themed, but
somehow abstract. This will allow easier retheming in a later stage, should
I change idea and decide for a different one (e.g. a more traditional
dungeon crawl).
