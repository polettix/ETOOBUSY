**TL;DR**

> Yesterday night we saw the International Space Station passing over a
> cloudy Roma.

And it was amazing: a little light dot that goes across the sky somehow
much like an airplane, but without the blinking *and* with the awareness
that it's about 400 km above!

If you too want to know when to look in the sky for it, you can browse
[Heavens Above][this site] and adjust it according to your position (the
link is set to Roma). It will even tell you where to look exactly with a
map like the following:

![map]({{ '/assets/images/iss-pass-example.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Have fun spotting this... IFO! (**Identified** Flying Object ðŸ˜„)
