**TL;DR**

> [perl-ldap][] rocks!

I recently had to gather some data from an Active Directory server.
After looking at some objects using a graphical interface, I quickly
realized that something *programmatic* was more up to the job.

So I turned to [Perl][], of course. So I turned to [CPAN][], of course.

It turns out that [perl-ldap][] has all I needed and was extremely easy
to install and use. There's been a bit of language impedance mismatch
because I was looking for a *login* method, which is just called `bind`.
Apart from this, everything was quite smooth actually.

A minimal example to get started searching stuff:

```perl
use v5.24;
use Net::LDAP;
use JSON::PP 'encode_json';
my $ad = Net::LDAP->($ENV{LDAP_HOST});
$ad->bind($ENV{LDAP_USER}, password => $ENV{LDAP_PASS});
my $results = $ad->search(
    base => $ENV{LDAP_BASE},
    filter => (shift(@ARGV) // '(cn=whatever)'),
);
my @records;
while (defined(my $entry = $results->shift_entry)) {
    push @records, entry2record($entry);
}
$ad->unbind; # logout
say encode_json(\@records);

sub entry2record {
    my $entry = shift;
    {
        map {
            my @values = $entry->get_value($_);
            $_ => (@values > 1 ? \@values : $values[0]);
        } $entry->attributes
    };
}
```

This is it, bye!
