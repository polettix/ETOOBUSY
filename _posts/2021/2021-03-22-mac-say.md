**TL;DR**

So I also wanted to get an audio clue about when my [Flaky internet

goes down, or when it gets up again.

This time I discovered [say][], which:

As this whole internet thing is... *upsetting* me a bit, I'll spare you with
the (Italian) text I'm using when the internet connection goes down 🙄, but
at least it says *e vai!* (like *yay!*) when it goes up again 😅

Stay safe and... *say something!*
