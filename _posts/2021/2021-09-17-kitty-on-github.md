**TL;DR**

> I put [Accounting-Kitty][] on [GitHub][] after... a few years.

It's part of a little plot against myself to push towards proper
documentation of how it's supposed to work. There's some documentation
already, and quite a few tests, so that should not be an herculean
effort.

One design decision that I made at the time is to stick with some SQL
database to back the thing up. In addiiton, I used [DBIx::Class][]
instad of going to a lower level - I don't know if out of a real *need*
or to study it. Anyway.

Cheers!
