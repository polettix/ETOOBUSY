**TL;DR**

> [WebService::Fake][] is being updated due to changes in
> [Mojolicious][].

It so happens that [Mojolicious][] has its deprecation cycle *and* that
sometimes it can hit you. It also happens that awesome people [tell you
about it][issue-5] but you don't get it the first time ðŸ™„

No worries: changes are included in the [Upgrading][] page.

In my case, the *barely-above-code-noise* module [WebService::Fake][]
was hit by the [Routing methods cleanup][]; the instructions on what to
change are clear, and they will hopefully also prove effective. Only
time will tell!

For now, [release 0.005-TRIAL][trial] has been uploaded to [CPAN][] to
see if anything else broke on the way. If not... I'll release more noise
in the coming days.
