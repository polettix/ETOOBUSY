**TL;DR**

It's no secret that I like a local directory to [Install Perl
Modules][], which made me think of a possible solution to use those
"private" libraries for commands that I want to have easy access to ([A
cheap trick to manipulate PERL5LIB][]).

Other times, though, I just like to have some modules installed locally
in a directory where I'm experimenting with something. For these cases,
I find it useful the following shell function:

```shell
local-lib() { 
    PERL5LIB="$PWD/local/lib/perl5";
    while [ $# -gt 0 ]; do
        local path="$(readlink -f "$1")";
        shift;
        PERL5LIB="$path:$PERL5LIB";
    done;
    export PERL5LIB
}
```

When called inside a directory, it sets `PERL5LIB` to the
`local/perl5/lib` (using the absolute path, which happens after
[til][]). If passed additional parameters, it adds them to `PERL5LIB`
too, which is handy if I'm trying out some new modules placed inside the
`lib` directory. This allows me to call this:

```shell
$ cd /somewhere

$ local-lib lib

$ printf '%s\n' "$PERL5LIB"
/somewhere/local/perl5/lib:/somewhere/lib
```

It's importan that the function is kept as a *shell function* -
otherwise, it will not set `PERL5LIB` in the current shell, but in a
subshell that will be lost after the program exits. For this reason, I
keep it in `~/.bashrc`.

I guess it's all! Have a nice day and stay safe!
