**TL;DR**

> I've been hit by [an alleged no-bug][] in [Raku][].

While doing some parsing for [Advent of Code][] [2018][aoc-2018] [puzzle
4][aoc-2018-04] I ended up with the following regular expression:

```raku
/Guard \s+ \# (\d+)/
```

Alas, this does not work in [Raku][]. The `#` character is considered to
be starting a comment *despite* the preceding backslash, eventually
making the rest of the line invisible to the parser and making the
compilation fail spectacularly:

```
$ raku
Welcome to ùêëùêöùê§ùêÆùêùùê®‚Ñ¢ v2021.07.
Implementing the ùêëùêöùê§ùêÆ‚Ñ¢ programming language v6.d.

===SORRY!===
Regex not terminated.

Unable to parse regex; couldn't find final '/'

------> <BOL>‚èè<EOL>
    expecting any of:

```

I looked around and it seems that there is no plan to fix this in
[Rakudo][]: ['#' literals in Grammars: syntax error][previous-bug]. So I
opened a [documentation issue][] about this.

The [workaround][] is to put the `#` character in *quotes*:

```raku
/Guard \s+ '#' (\d+)/
```

which works fine:

```
> '[15818-11-01 00:00+ Guard #10 begins shift' ~~ /Guard \s+ '#' (\d+)/
ÔΩ¢Guard #10ÔΩ£
 0 => ÔΩ¢10ÔΩ£
```

Actually, *workaround* is a bit of a misnomer, as it's really a
different, approved and maybe even suggested way of doing this kind of
things. But you know, conciseness.

Another way of doing this might be to create a *character class*
for the character, like this:

```raku
/Guard \s+ <[#]> (\d+)/
```

Is it any better? I don't know, maybe it's a bit too *line-noisy*...

Anyway, if you need to put `#` in your [Raku][] regular expressions...
*quote it* or, at least, *don't escape it*!

Stay safe and have `-Ofun` people!
