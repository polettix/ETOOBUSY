**TL;DR**

> A new example regarding [App::Easer][].

I started adding some example applications to [App::Easer][] and I
thought that a toy to-do list manager would be perfect.

This led to [tudu][] (it's how an Italian would write todo when hearing
it).

It's simple but it shows a lot of the characteristics that are available
through [App::Easer][]:

- getting defaults from a configuration file
- using environment variables
- automatic generation of help for all commands
- description of commands through metadata, implementing them through
  functions in a module

*Future me* should appreciate! In the meantime... stay safe everyone!
