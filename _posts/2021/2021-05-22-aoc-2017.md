**TL;DR**

> I recently completed [Advent of Code][] [2017][aoc2017].

And I totally enjoyed it.

![AoC 2017 final situation]({{ '/assets/images/aoc2017-final.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

I put it in pause for a couple of months because section 2 of [puzzle
20][] put me in *paralysis by analysis* due to concerns about the
complexity.

Well, actually I had no clue on how to approach it and I was thinking
that I could just run the simulation *for some time*. Except I wouldn't
be sure about when to stop...

I eventually landed on a $O(n^2)$ algorithm to pre-compute *all possible
crossings*, and then analyze them in order of occurrence.

The rest of the puzzles were OK and, as usual, I liked it very much to
receive the final gold star... for free.

If you want to pass some time coding for fun I suggest [Advent of
Code][] puzzles a lot... they're really engaging!

Have fun and stay safe folks!
