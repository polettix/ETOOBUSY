**TL;DR**

> [netpbm][] can come handy.

Today I needed to have some visualization of how some data were
arranged, so I remembered that there's a *very simple* format that
allows printing out images quite easily: something to do with `pnm`.

(This is the sort of information that tends to fill the recesses of my
mind until the glorious day of their usefulness comes out. Sort of when
you buy that fascinating set of wrenches, which will come out useful
some 15 years later after about moving them around for 5 relocations,
the last one being just on top of a hardware store).

It turns out that the one format that made my day was [PGM][], i.e. the
*Portable Grayscale Map*. It represents - unsurprisingly - a grayscale
image, with a dynamic range that is set in the file itself by a
parameter.

This is a working example of a grayscale image:

```pgm
P2
16 16
255
163 163 163 163 163 208 208 208 124 124 124 124 124  66  66  66
255 163 163 163 163 163 208 208 208 124 124 124 124 124  66  66
255 255 163 163 163 163 163 208 208 208 124 124 124 124 124  66
255 255 255 255 163 163 163 163 208 208 208 124 124 124 124  66
106 255 255 255 255 163 163 163 163 208 208 208 124 124 124 124
106 106 255 255 255 255 163 163 163 163 208 208 124 124 124 124
106 106 106 255 255 255 163 163 163 163 163 208 208 124 124 124
106 106 106 106 106 255 255 163 163 163 163 208 208 208 124 124
 58 106 106 106 106 106 255 255 163 163 163 208 208 208 208 124
 58  58 106 106 106 106 106 255 255 163 163 163 208 208 208 124
 58  58 106 106 106 106 106 106 255 255 163 163 163 208 208 208
 58  58  58  58 106 106 106 106 106 255 255 163 163 163 208 208
  0  58  58  58  58  58 106 106 106 106 255 163 163 163 163 208
  0   0   0  58  58  58  58 106 106 106 106 255 163 163 163 163
  0   0   0   0   0  58  58  58 106 106 106 106 255 163 163 163
  0   0   0   0   0   0  58  58  58 106 106 106 106 163 163 163
```

So... it's just printing out values after a minimal header:

- the `P2` string
- the *width* and the *height*, in this order
- the *maximum value*, corresponding to white (greater than `0` and less
  than `65536`)
- the data, starting from top-left and ending on bottom-right

That's it. It's possible to use whatever whitespace separator between
all items, the arrangement above is only *cosmetic* and every sample
might be on its own line, or be arranged differently (with some
limitations).

This is the resulting image, in [PNG format][PNG] (16x magnification):

![Example image in PNG format]({{ '/assets/images/pgm-example.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Actually I generated the image with an editor, then used [Gimp][] to
convert it to a [PGM][] format. To re-arrange its output in the way
shown in the textual example above, I used the following [Perl][]
program:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl
use v5.24;
use warnings;

my $text;
while (<>) {
   s{\# .*}{}gmxs;
   s{\s+\z}{}mxs;
   $text .= ' ' . $_;
}
substr $text, 0, 1, '';

my ($format, $width, $height, $max, @items) = split m{\s+}mxs, $text;

say $format;
say $width, ' ', $height;
say $max;
say join ' ', splice @items, 0, $width for 1 .. $height;

die 'residual stuff!' if @items;
```

Well, now you know, myself of the future: if you want to quickly
visualize some data in a kind of *heatmap*, [PGM][] is worth
considering!

Have fun everyone, and stay safe please!
