**TL;DR**

Which pretty much says it all. Since yesterday... I added searching
through records and getting a dump that is good for BIND, as well as
some documentation and examples. All of which have ample margins of
enhancement, of course.

I'm thinking about using the search facility and add an option to the
delete facility. Maybe with the addition of a `--dry-run` option, just
to be on the safe side.

Anyway, I'm pretty OK with this program as of now, because it will
hopefully cover my needs to come.

Stay safe folks!
