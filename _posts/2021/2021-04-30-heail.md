**TL;DR**

> A little utility condensing the gist of [head][] and [tail][].

`heail` is a little [Perl][] program to get the [head][] and [tail][] of
the input at the same time:

<script src="https://gitlab.com/polettix/notechs/-/snippets/2109512.js"></script>

[Local copy here][].

If you're wondering, its name comes from merging **hea**d with t**ail**.
Well, I didn't like *heil*.

Call like this:

```shell
some-command | heail 5  # keep 5 lines from head and 5 lines from tail
```

Example:

```shell
$ for i in $(seq 1 10); do printf %s\\n "$i"; done | heail 3
1
2
3
...
8
9
10
```

It tries to do the right thing if the number of available lines fit
within both limits.

There's plenty of space for improvement... and for suggesting the
*right* tool to do this. Waiting!
