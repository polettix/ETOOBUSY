**TL;DR**

> I completed [Advent of Code][] [2021][aoc2021].

And it's been a tumultuous ride!

A few things I learned (*but there are others!*):

- the word *hell* can be considered a profanity. This surprised me
  because the italian equivalent is not considered such, and I could not
  find any mention of this in Merriam-Webster. *Interesting*.
- I **know of** many algorithms, but I can't say I **know** many
  algorithms. There's been a lot of re-reading, which is fine anyway.
- [Raku][] is fun *and* frustrating to use.
    - I still have to wrap my head around using basic data structures in
      the right way. I definitely missed the ease of [Perl][]'s approach
      as in *arrays flatten by default, use a reference if you don't
      want to*. The *auto-boxing* behavior still leaves me throwing
      `.Slip`, `.flat` and `.List` around, and too many times I added a
      `.Array` just to avoid being reminded that I can't do this or that
      with a List. (My bad, anyway!)
    - I missed the ease of using [dclone][], although this is space for
      studying how to do this properly and easily in [Raku][].
    - It's still relatively slow and this is not amazing when paired
      with poor algorithms and implementations ðŸ™„
- When my program is being running for a good 30 minutes late at night,
  trying to refine solutions for a better one... I discovered myself
  just taking that last value and trying it as an answer. Think those
  movies where the timer is approaching 0 and they cut the red wire just
  because. (By the way... *it worked* and I went to sleep).

There's still a (metric) ton to read and discover and learn... I'll
surely read through [the solutions][] of the puzzles I found most
frustrating, just after my hatr**AHEM**animosity against them wears off!

Whatever your culture... have a good day and stay safe!
