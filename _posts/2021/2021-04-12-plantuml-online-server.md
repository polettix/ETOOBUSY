**TL;DR**

> If you're in a hurry, [PlantUML][] has an [online server][].

One interesting feature of [PlantUML][] over [sdedit][] is that you
don't need to install anything if you're really in a hurry (or you
don't *want* to install anything).

The [online server][] allows you to design your graphs online. The fun
thing is that its API encodes the full diagram *into the URL*, so as
long as the [online server][] is... online, you should see an example
picture here:

I guess that in 2021 we're a little *spoiled* and not used to hit the
**submit** button to see the updates in our editing... but hey! It's
free and immensely useful even without the cool things of today's web!
