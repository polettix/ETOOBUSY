**TL;DR**

> Here we are with [TASK #1][] from [The Weekly Challenge][]
> [#139][]. Enjoy!

# The challenge

> You are given a list of numbers.
>
> Write a script to implement JortSort. It should return true/false
> depending if the given list of numbers are already sorted.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
>     Input: @n = (1,2,3,4,5)
>     Output: 1
>
>     Since the array is sorted, it prints 1.
>
> **Example 2:**
>
>     Input: @n = (1,3,2,4,5)
>     Output: 0
>
>     Since the array is NOT sorted, it prints 0.

# The questions

*What the heck is [JortSort][]?!?*

(And well, thanks for giving us these candies!)

(Also... is it OK to assume that we're talking numbers here?!?)

# The solution

OK, this is about comparing two arrays, one being the original one and
the other being its sorted version.

In [Raku][] we can leverage the matching operator to compare the two
arrays, I hope I'm not missing the real meaning of it:

```raku
#!/usr/bin/env raku
use v6;
sub MAIN (*@args) { say jort-sort(@args) ?? 1 !! 0 }
sub jort-sort (@args) { @args.sort ~~ @args }
```

In [Perl][] there's a little more road to go, though not too much:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl
use v5.24;
use warnings;
use experimental 'signatures';
no warnings 'experimental::signatures';
say jort_sort(@ARGV) ? 1 : 0;
sub jort_sort (@args) {
   for (sort @args) { return 0 unless $_ == shift @args }
   return 1
}
```

I guess it's everything... and I hope I didn't miss the point!
