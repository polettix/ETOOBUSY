**TL;DR**

> So yes, it's finally **one complete year** of posting.

At the beginning of 2020 I challenged myself to output one (small) blog
post daily for a whole year. Alas, some events did come in the way and I
had some interruptions.

Well, that happened up to [June 20th, 2020][j202020] when I restarted the daily
post habit. Yesterday I published the last entry of one complete year of
posting, so... yay!

It's been a long year but it's also been rewarding. I hope to be able to
continue this habit... who knows?

Stay safe everybody, and have fun!
