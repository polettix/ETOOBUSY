**TL;DR**

> I started reading through [Think Bayes][].

[Think Bayes][] is an interesting book by [Allen B. Downey][]. The title
does not try to hide it: it's about Bayesian statistics, which is a
topic that I keep coming back to from time to time. Like when you often
do the same dream, you know?

In the words of the author (or, at least, of the page about it):

Although there's [Think Bayes 2e][] (i.e. *second edition*) available,
I'm still reading through the first edition at [Think Bayes][] because
it's a bit easier for me to follow with the code.

Code examples are in *plain* Python in the first edition, but leverage a
few frameworks in the second. As my goal would be to try those examples
in [Raku][] instead, so that I can learn it a bit more, I find it easier
to adapt the plain Python code. So it's an occasion to do some double
learning - hoping they will not thwart each other.

The author also provides other freely available books through [Green Tea
Press][], so go check them out!
