**TL;DR**

> Here we are with [TASK #1][] from the [Perl Weekly Challenge][]
> [#105][]. Enjoy!

# The challenge

> You are given positive numbers `$N` and `$k`. Write a script to find out
> the `$N`th root of `$k`. For more information, please take a look at the
> [wiki page][].

# The questions

The first and foremost question that popped in my mind was... *am I reading
this challenge right*? Looking at the [wiki page][] just got me more
confused.

But well, it's clearly stated that the two numbers are positive, and I
definitely remember that extracting the $k$-th root of a number $N$ is the
same as elevating that number to $k^{-1}$, ending with $N^{k^{-1}}$... so
why not?!?

# The solution

This solution allowed me discover that the exponentiation operator in
[Perl][] is right associative. Which is actually very good in this case, as
the solution can be written almost completely in terms of exponentiations,
just like the formula above:

```perl
sub nth_root ($N, $k) { return $N ** $k ** -1 }
```

Come to think about it, the operator is probably right-associative *exactly*
because in this way it matches how stuff like this would be laid out. Just
like the formula above, I mean.

I said almost because we still have to use the `-` sign in front of the `1`.
Let's say that it's up to you to think of it as just a convention to write
an integer, or actually think that `1` is the star and `-1` is just
expressed in terms of it by using a subtraction operation from an imaginary
`0`.

Well, time for the whole code:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl
use 5.024;
use warnings;
use experimental 'signatures';
no warnings 'experimental::signatures';

sub nth_root ($N, $k) { return $N ** $k ** -1 }

my $N_ = shift || 34;
my $k_ = shift || 5;
say nth_root($N_, $k_);
```

Stay safe folks!
