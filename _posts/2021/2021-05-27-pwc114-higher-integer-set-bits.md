# The questions

Apart from assuming that the *input representation* will *necessarily*
be in base 10, I guess that no further clarifications are necessary.

# The solution

As I said in previous post [PWC114 - Next Palindrome Number][],
challenges can be addressed via *brute force* or with *aimed*
strategies.

Well, this time I opted for *brute force* ðŸ™„

I first take note of the number of bits in the input. Then I start
counting from the successor, until I find a number with the same amount
of bits. Soooo boring.

Here's the complete program in [Perl][]:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl
use 5.024;
use warnings;
use experimental qw< postderef signatures >;
no warnings qw< experimental::postderef experimental::signatures >;

sub higher_integer_set_bits ($N) {
   sub n_bits ($x) { sprintf('%b', $x) =~ tr/1/1/ };
   my $initial = n_bits($N);
   while ('necessary') {
      ++$N;
      return $N if $initial == n_bits($N);
   }
}

@ARGV = 3 unless @ARGV;
say higher_integer_set_bits($_) for @ARGV;
```

Here's the correspondent program in (baby) [Raku][]:

```raku
#!/usr/bin/env raku
use v6;

sub higher-integer-set-bits (Int $N is copy) {
   sub n-bits ($x) { ($x.base(2) ~~ m:g/1/).elems };
   my $initial = n-bits($N);
   while True {
      ++$N;
      return $N if $initial == n-bits($N);
   }
}

sub MAIN (*@inputs is copy) {
   @inputs.push(3) unless @inputs.elems;
   higher-integer-set-bits($_).say for @inputs;
}
```

The old trick of counting stuff using the `tr` operator seems to be gone
for good. We're resorting to counting the matches, hoping it's not that
bad efficiency-wide (I mean, it will be a limited amount of bits
anyway).

Stay safe folks!
