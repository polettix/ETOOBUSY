**TL;DR**

> I recently changed my job.

And that is pretty much it! Let's see where it leads me.

I'd like to spend a few words about my previous employer, [Ericsson][].
Because, you know... if one leaves a place, it *might* not be a good
sign.

Well, this is *not* the case. It's a terrific place to work, and I say
this in the positive sense. In the past 20 years I've spent there, part
as a consultant and part as an employee, I had the luck to participate
into a plethora of projects and initiatives in a wide range of topics
and have a lot of fun.

Not only this, people are amazing. I mean, there's the usual share of
people that don't necessarily blend etc., but my personal experience is
that it's very, very easy to find people that's a pleasure to work with.

I also learned a lot there. Sometimes it might seen that there's too
much "structure", but the mindset is to make things right, to learn from
past errors and to aim for excellence. I hope I'll be able to bring
those with me in the new job!

So my suggestion is: if you're considering switching job, take
[Ericsson][] into consideration.
