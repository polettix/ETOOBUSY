**TL;DR**

> Puzzles in [Advent of Code][] [2018 edition][aoc-2018] are fun (so
> far!).

If you're looking for some diversion or something to do some exercising
(e.g. learning some [Raku][]), I would suggest you giving [Advent of
Code][] a try.

These days I'm on the [2018 edition][aoc-2018] and I'm enjoying it so
far. Well, [more or less][].

In particular, in the last days I appreciated a couple of puzzles:

- [puzzle 7][] is a nice variation on the problem of scheduling tasks.
  It builds up, by first asking to produce a simple plan ordering tasks
  so that pre-requisites are executed before their descendants, then
  asking also to take execution time and parall execution into
  consideration;
- [puzzle 8][] asks you to parse the input to build up a tree, then
  execute a couple of queries over it.

The second would have been great to learn [Raku Grammars][] but it
seemed difficult to express the variable size nature of the children's
list, so I opted for a more traditional recursive solution based on
subroutines. I suspect this would have been a good time to try them out
though.

Well, enough notekeeping for today, stay safe and have `-Ofun` people!
