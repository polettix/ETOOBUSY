**TL;DR**

> [Data::HexDump::XXD][] can turn out useful.

A long time ago (almost 14 years!) I liked the output of [vim][]'s utility
[xxd][] so much that I wrote a module to re-generate its output in [Perl][].
This is where [Data::HexDump::XXD][] comes from.

(Technically speaking *I don't know* whether [xxd][] is distributed as a
part of [vim][], but it is [surely distributed with vim][xxd-vim]).

The usage is pretty straightforward: feed it with bytes, get a string back.
Or: feed it with a hex dump, get the bytes back. Like this:

```perl
use Data::HexDump::XXD qw( xxd xxd_r );
 
my $dump_string = xxd($binary_data);
my @dumped_lines = xxd($binary_data);
 
my $binary = xxd_r($xxd_like_string);
my $binary = xxd_r(@xxd_like_lines);
```

This is one of the modules from that had the most success so far: it is
*optionally* used by another module if the user wants a hex dump of
something. If you're skeptical, take a look at [Devel::StringInfo][]!

All this fame will make my ego explode one day or another ðŸ˜„
