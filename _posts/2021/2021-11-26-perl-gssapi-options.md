**TL;DR**

It's no secret I'm messing with [Net::LDAP][] and [Kerberos][] too, which
means using [Authen::SASL][] with a [GSSAPI][] mechanism.

Confused? Well, I was, and I probably still am - although possibly a bit
less. More on this in some future post, anyway.

One specific problem I encountered while trying to make the
[getcred\_hostbased.pl][example] example ([local version here][]) work
was about some automatic DNS resolutions and canonicalization actions
performed by the library, which make working with the [FreeIPA demo][]
impossible

There seems to be no place where to put additional options in the
[GSSAPI][] bindings, and probably in the whole `GSSAPI` thing, which is
a generic mechanism that *might* be tied to [Kerberos][], but not
necessarily.

One way to get those options in place is through a configuration file,
which the library goes to look for based on environment variable `KRB5_CONFIG`. In my case, to disable the annoyance it sufficed to do this:

```shell
$ export KRB5_CONFIG="$PWD/custom-krb5.conf"
$ cat > "$KRB5_CONFIG" <<'END'
[libdefaults]
dns_canonicalize_hostname = false
default_ccache_name = MEMORY
END
```

Actually... only disabling `dns_canonicalize_hostname` was needed to
make the example work, but I decided to avoid cluttering the filesystem
anyway ðŸ˜…

Now I'm left wandering how many security pitfalls are hidden in this
intricate way of setting a few options... ðŸ¤¯  I'll probably go look into
`ldapsearch` to see what they do.

Stay safe folks!
