**TL;DR**

> I found an old Commodore 64 manual.

A few days ago I was moving some stuff and stumbled upon an old copy of
the Italian version of the Commodore 64 manual. It is available
[here][], by the way.

I gave a look at it and remembered how I read it through and through
multiple times. In hindsight, I have to say that it was, and still is,
an exceptional manual.

I was struck by this (from [the English version][], but it's the same in
Italian):

> Commodore is known as The Friendly Computer company, and part of being
> friendly is giving you easy to read, easy to use and easy to
> understand instruction manuals. 

I mean... wow, that was really amazing!
