**TL;DR**

> Getting the **name** of a sub and other amenities with [Sub::Util][].

After [writing about `Sub::Import`][post] I also decided to give
[Sub::Util][] a try. It actually popped up while I was looking for
[Sub::Import][]'s because it does something... in the same *area*.

Let's expand the example from the last time:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl
use 5.024;
use warnings;
use experimental qw< postderef signatures >;
no warnings qw< experimental::postderef experimental::signatures >;

use FindBin '$Bin';
use lib "$Bin/local/lib/perl5", "$Bin/lib";

use Sub::Import 'MIME::Base64', encode_base64 => {-as => 'e64'},
use Sub::Util qw< subname set_subname >;

say 'e64 is currently ', subname(\&e64);
set_subname('e64, but for messing up!', \&e64);
say 'e64 is now known as "', subname(\&e64), '" in the right circles';
```

Output:

```
e64 is currently MIME::Base64::encode_base64
e64 is now known as "main::e64, but for messing up!" in the right circles
```

[Sub::Util][] contains a few functions, two of which are related to a
*sub's name*. The first one, `subname`, tells you what's the *current*
name of a sub reference:

```perl
say 'e64 is currently ', subname(\&e64);

# e64 is currently MIME::Base64::encode_base64
```

The other one is `set_subname`, which allows to set the name *but only
for consumption by `subname`* or other introspection code. In other
terms, it *does not* install a sub with that name, it only record the
association between the provided sub reference and a string. Which means
that... the name can be whatever string!

This is why this works:

```perl
set_subname('e64, but for messing up!', \&e64);
say 'e64 is now known as "', subname(\&e64), '" in the right circles';

# e64 is now known as "main::e64, but for messing up!" in the right circles
```

I think this is brilliant!
