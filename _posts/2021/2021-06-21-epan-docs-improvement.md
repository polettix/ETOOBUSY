**TL;DR**

> Documentation for [epan][] should be better now.

After publishing [App::EPAN][], I was horrified to see that I didn't
update the documentation for the main program.

How could that be possible?!?

Well, I did that eventually, so a new release is on its way. Apologies
if I caused any inconvenience with the inconsistencies between the
documentation and the real program ðŸ˜…

(Yes I know, I'm the only user of [epan][] in the multiverse... but
dreaming is so cheap!)
