**TL;DR**

> I proposed a [pull request][] for [Path::Tiny][].

Some days ago I was using [Path::Tiny][] ([remember it][]?) and at a
certain point I had an object pointing to a directory, where I wanted to
save a file.

`pop`

OK, so I'm with my [Path::Tiny][] directory object, and first of all I
want to *create a temporary file in that directory*. The module has a
method for it, namely `tempfile`:

```perl
my $tempfile = Path::Tiny->tempfile(...);
```

How cute, a *class method*... a tiny, little *class method*... well
*there MUST be an instance method too, right?*

**RIGHT?!?**

Well... no. There is [issue #115][] though, which deals exactly with
this and has the following refreshing comment from [Path::Tiny][]'s
author and maintainer:

> Interesting idea. It would really just mean setting the "DIR" option
> to the current path (unless a DIR option is provided). I'm open to a

So here I am, one day into [Hacktoberfest][], to propose [a pull request
to address this][pull request].

To be completely honest, it *does not* do what they are asking. I mean,
I thought about the *unless a DIR option is provided* part in the
comment, and in my (very) humble opinion in that case the object should
still win over the option. If you want the option... then use the class
method, it's just more readable. Of course this is *my* take on this,
and it can be changed quite easily.

Help me to cross as many fingers as possible ðŸ¤žðŸ¤žðŸ¤ž and... stay safe!
