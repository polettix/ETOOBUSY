**TL;DR**

> [Test::CLI][] helps doing tests through command-line applications.

Most of the time in my *amateur programmer* time I wrote tests to do some
exercising of the programs I was working on. Sometimes, though, it so
happens that I trust the programs, but I want to use them to test the
environment a bit.

This is (also) where [Test::CLI][] can come handy.

As an example, suppose you want to make an automated test that some virtual
machines are active in your Openstack project. To get the list, you would
run:

```
$ openstack server list
+-------+--------+----------+--------------+-------+--------+
| ID    | Name   | Status   | Networks     | Image | Flavor |
+-------+--------+----------+--------------+-------+--------+
| 01... | bar-00 | ACTIVE   | foo=10.0.1.1 |       | bar    |
| 23... | bar-01 | ACTIVE   | foo=10.0.1.2 |       | bar    |
| 45... | bar-02 | ACTIVE   | foo=10.0.1.3 |       | bar    |
| 67... | bar-03 | ACTIVE   | foo=10.0.1.4 |       | bar    |
| 89... | bar-04 | ACTIVE   | foo=10.0.1.5 |       | bar    |
| ab... | bar-05 | SHUTDOWN | foo=10.0.1.6 |       | bar    |
| cd... | bar-06 | ACTIVE   | foo=10.0.1.7 |       | bar    |
| ef... | baz-00 | ACTIVE   | foo=10.0.1.8 |       | baz    |
+-------+--------+----------+--------------+-------+--------+
```

This command should succeed and provide an output like the above example...
except that `bar-05` should be in `ACTIVE` state, not `SHUTDOWN`.

With [Test::CLI][], you might do the following:

```perl
use Test::More;
use Test::CLI 'tc';
my $tc = tc(qw< openstack server list >);
$tc->run_ok;
my @machines = map { sprintf 'bar-%02d', $_ } 0 .. 6;
push @machines, 'baz-00';
$tc->stdout_like(qr{\s $_ [\s|]+ ACTIVE \s}mxs) for @machines;
done_testing();
```

Running this program gives us:

```
$ perl test.pl 
ok 1 - openstack server list
ok 2 - (stdout match (?^umsx:\s bar-00 [\s|]+ ACTIVE \s) on) openstack server list
ok 3 - (stdout match (?^umsx:\s bar-01 [\s|]+ ACTIVE \s) on) openstack server list
ok 4 - (stdout match (?^umsx:\s bar-02 [\s|]+ ACTIVE \s) on) openstack server list
ok 5 - (stdout match (?^umsx:\s bar-03 [\s|]+ ACTIVE \s) on) openstack server list
ok 6 - (stdout match (?^umsx:\s bar-04 [\s|]+ ACTIVE \s) on) openstack server list
not ok 7 - (stdout match (?^umsx:\s bar-05 [\s|]+ ACTIVE \s) on) openstack server list
# Failed test '(stdout match (?^umsx:\s bar-05 [\s|]+ ACTIVE \s) on) openstack server list'
# at ../lib/Test/CLI.pm line 165.
# stdout: did not match (?^umsx:\s bar-05 [\s|]+ ACTIVE \s)
ok 8 - (stdout match (?^umsx:\s bar-06 [\s|]+ ACTIVE \s) on) openstack server list
ok 9 - (stdout match (?^umsx:\s baz-00 [\s|]+ ACTIVE \s) on) openstack server list
1..9
# Looks like you failed 1 test of 9.
```

This can be of course be put in a harness:

```
$ prove -v test.pl 
test.pl .. 
ok 1 - openstack server list
ok 2 - (stdout match (?^umsx:\s bar-00 [\s|]+ ACTIVE \s) on) openstack server list
ok 3 - (stdout match (?^umsx:\s bar-01 [\s|]+ ACTIVE \s) on) openstack server list
ok 4 - (stdout match (?^umsx:\s bar-02 [\s|]+ ACTIVE \s) on) openstack server list
ok 5 - (stdout match (?^umsx:\s bar-03 [\s|]+ ACTIVE \s) on) openstack server list
ok 6 - (stdout match (?^umsx:\s bar-04 [\s|]+ ACTIVE \s) on) openstack server list
not ok 7 - (stdout match (?^umsx:\s bar-05 [\s|]+ ACTIVE \s) on) openstack server list

# Failed test '(stdout match (?^umsx:\s bar-05 [\s|]+ ACTIVE \s) on) openstack server list'
# at ../lib/Test/CLI.pm line 165.
# stdout: did not match (?^umsx:\s bar-05 [\s|]+ ACTIVE \s)
ok 8 - (stdout match (?^umsx:\s bar-06 [\s|]+ ACTIVE \s) on) openstack server list
ok 9 - (stdout match (?^umsx:\s baz-00 [\s|]+ ACTIVE \s) on) openstack server list
1..9
# Looks like you failed 1 test of 9.
Dubious, test returned 1 (wstat 256, 0x100)
Failed 1/9 subtests

I think this is it!
