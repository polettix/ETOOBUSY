**TL;DR**

> Meet [xmpl][], an example web application with flexible deployment

Every now and then I need to deploy a simple *example application* to
make some tests, e.g. in [Kubernetes][]. So, in time I collected some
*needs* and eventually managed to collapse them all inside a single
application: [xmpl][].

It is based on [Mojolicious][] and, of course, is run by [Perl][].

If you have a similar need, head over to the [README.md][] file and read
what it can do for you! In the meantime, let's take a quick look at a
couple of examples...

# A simple key/value store

The basic idea is to provide something *dynamic* to interact with, with
the possibility to make it *stateful*. For this reason, the basic API
that is provided allows manipulating a *key-value store*.

In the basic level, the key-value store is entirely managed in memory
and no access to the filesystem is necessary; this gives the dynamicity
of the API, but without sacrificing the possibility to consider the
component as *stateless*.

It's easy to run an instance that just provides the basic API using the
in-memory key/value store (which is a simple [Perl][] hash):

```shell
xmpl daemon
```

The command above will run the application on port `3000`, but you can
change it of course, e.g. to `3456`:

```shell
xmpl daemon -l 'http://*:3456'
```

# A persistent key/value store

It's possible to start the application process and ask it to keep a
persistent copy of the key/value store. The application will expose the
same exact external API, only data will also be saved to a file and thus
it will make it possible to reuse the saved key/pairs across different
invocations of the program.

The key is to set the environment variable `KVSTORE` to a local path:

```shell
KVSTORE='./repo.json' xmpl daemon -l 'http://*:4000'
```

The command above will run an instance of the web application, listening
on port `4000` and making sure that the key/value store is saved to file
`repo.json` in the current directory.

# A remote key/value store

It's also possible to chain two (or more!) instances of [xmpl][] using a
*remote* configuration. This means that an instance can be instructed to
invoke the API provided by another instance, so that typical topologies
with a *frontend* and a *backend* can be implemented (even with multiple
tiering levels).

Again, they key is to set environment variable `KVSTORE`, this time with
a HTTP/HTTPS URL. As an example, we can connect to the file-backed
instance of the previous section like this:

```shell
KVSTORE='http://localhost:4000' xmpl daemon -l 'http://*:8080'
```

This will make the new instance listen on port `8080` and use the
instance on port `4000` as its backend.

# Use the browser, it works!

The [README.md][] file describes the whole API, but it's worth noting
that you can point the browser to the root of the application and get a
page back, that you can use to manipulate the key/value store through
*normal* browser-based interactions (via forms, buttons, etc.).

# This is (almost) it!

This is enough for this introduction, further (updated) information can
be found in the [README.md][].

I hope it will be useful for you!
