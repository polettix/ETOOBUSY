**TL;DR**

I don't really know much about [OAuth 1.0][], and I can live with that. One
thing I know is that [WWW::OAuth][] can be set to handle this protocol
automatically with [Mojo::UserAgent][], as can be seen in the documentation:

```perl
my $ua = Mojo::UserAgent->new;
$ua->on(start => sub { $oauth->authenticate($_[1]->req) });
```

This is a simple program to download a random SVG image from [The Noun
Project][], via their [API][].

<script src="https://gitlab.com/polettix/notechs/snippets/1933476.js"></script>

The *term* to be searched can be passed as the first command-line option.
You are supposed to put your credentials in a JSON-formatted file, by
default `noun-project.json` (although you can pass the file path on the
command line as a second parameter).

The constructor (lines 18-21) is just the plain one from the documentation.
Then it is set as an automatic handler in the user agent (lines 23 and 24),
so that every request will be handled automatically. This makes this user
agent *specialized* for the specific API endpoint, which is fine in our
case. Otherwise... you can always create a new agent instance ðŸ˜‰

The rest is just plain [Mojo::UserAgent][] usage: get the right [API][]
endpoint (we're looking for the specific `$term` among the public domain
icons), select one `icon_url` randomly inside and download it locally. Easy!
