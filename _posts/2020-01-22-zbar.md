**TL;DR**

> Intrigued by reading [QR codes][] from [Perl][]? [Barcode::ZBar][] can be your
> friend!

I can't really tell you why I care about reading [QR codes][] at all - I've
never really needed to do that programmatically. But the *possibility* to do
this in [Perl][] always intrigued me. Do you share the same curiosity? Let's
be [Barcode::ZBar][]'s guests together, then!

## Installing dependencies

If you want to give it a try before you buy, I suggest to [Try with
Docker][]! Just make sure to install both `libzbar-dev` and `perlmagick`.

After this, you have to install [Barcode::ZBar][] somewhere. You know what I
think about [Installing Perl Modules][] so I will not repeat that here.
Spoiler: use `carton`.

## Getting a sample QR code

There are a lot of QR code generators around, I chose [QR Code Generator][]
because it allows saving in a PNG image. You can generate your own or just
use the one below (which you can [download from here][japh]):

![JAPH]({{ '/assets/images/2020-01-japh.png' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})


## The example program

I took the [example program from CPAN][scan-image], as of release 0.04 of
[Barcode::ZBar][]:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl
use warnings;
use strict;
require Image::Magick;
require Barcode::ZBar;
 
$ARGV[0] || die;
 
# create a reader
my $scanner = Barcode::ZBar::ImageScanner->new();
 
# configure the reader
$scanner->parse_config("enable");
 
# obtain image data
my $magick = Image::Magick->new();
$magick->Read($ARGV[0]) && die;
my $raw = $magick->ImageToBlob(magick => 'GRAY', depth => 8);
 
# wrap image data
my $image = Barcode::ZBar::Image->new();
$image->set_format('Y800');
$image->set_size($magick->Get(qw(columns rows)));
$image->set_data($raw);
 
# scan the image for barcodes
my $n = $scanner->scan_image($image);
 
# extract results
foreach my $symbol ($image->get_symbols()) {
    # do something useful with results
    print('decoded ' . $symbol->get_type() .
          ' symbol "' . $symbol->get_data() . "\"\n");
}
 
# clean up
undef($image);
```

## Running it

It turns out that running it actually works:

```
root@769f7f634955:/mnt# perl -I local/lib/perl5 qr-decode.pl 2020-01-japh.png 
decoded QR-Code symbol "Just Another Perl Hacker"
```

Amazing! To say that [QR codes][] aren't even mentiones in the
[Barcode::ZBar][] documentation ðŸ˜…

## Wrap-up

So... it seems that it's not difficult to use [Barcode::ZBar][] after all.
Why don't you give it a try then?
