Which does not indeed tell us much. OK, let's restart:

Better now?

# Where did it start

By now, you are probably quite tired by the series [Allocating games in
tournaments][]. I don't blame you. But let's recap what I mean with
tournament of 4 players per match here:

> A number $n$ of participants play a game where each match has $k$
> participants at the table. Matches are arranged so that each player
> competes against each other exactly once. Moreover, matches are
> arranged in rounds, so that all participants can play almost at the
> same time.

We already saw that this is indeed possible many times, leading to a
number of participants that is the square of the number of players at
each table/match. As an example, games with 4 players at the table imply
16 participants.

Can I have more players?

# Sure we can do more?

Sure we can.

An example is the [Kirkman Schoolgirls Problem][], where we are asked to
arrange 15 schoolgirls in groups of three each for seven consecutive
days, so that each schoolgirl is in the same group as any other one
exactly once. Sounds familiar? It's the same as our definition of
tournament above, with three players at the table and 15 overall
participants.

So yes, we can organize tournaments for three-players tables with both 9
and 15 participants. It turns out that also 21, 27, ... participants are
possible.

# Four game tournaments

Another interesting configuration is for four-players tables. There are
a *few* designs of type $S(2, 4, 28)$, most of which are present in a
file that can be downloaded from this page: [Steiner 2-designs][].

The different columns of each blocks of 1 and 0 represent a *match*,
while rows represent participants. In this case, each block has 28 rows
and 63 columns.

One nice property of tournaments is that matches are scheduled so that
players are active in all rounds. A little search over all the designs
in the download link ended up finding that only six designs allow for
packing all matches in exactly 9 rounds of 7 matches each (which is the
maximum that can be done, because there are 28 participants divided in
groups of 4 at each round). They are number 484, 503, 912, 913, 977, and
1002.

For our tournament purposes, one suffices - let's take 1002:

The arrangement of matches into rounds is as follows (actually, this is
an isomorphic arrangement obtained by first re-arranging the incidence
matrix above by re-sorting columns and rows):

```text
1,2,3,4:5,12,19,20:6,15,25,26:7,10,13,16:8,14,18,22:9,11,24,28:17,21,23,27
