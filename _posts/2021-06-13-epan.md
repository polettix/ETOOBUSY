**TL;DR**

> I released [App::EPAN][].

A lot of people proposed solutions for keeping some version of a local
[CPAN][], for various reasons (like, e.g., keeping a *DarkPAN*, that is
a CPAN-like mirror with private modules).

In spirit of good wheel reinvention, about 10 years ago I coded [epan][]
and... never released it on [CPAN][]. Until now.

Most of the work is done by [cpanm][], which includes saving the
downloaded distribution files into an appropriate directory. But... those
files cannot be used (not even by [cpanm][], as I understand it)
*directly* without some indexes, which is where [App::EPAN][] kicks in.

Similarly, [Carton][] can save the files (and actually use them!), but you
cannot use those files with a [CPAN][] client directly. Which, again, is
a small use case for [App::EPAN][].

Using it is simple, e.g. to create a local repository with [Mojolicious][]
and [IO::Socket::SSL][]:

```shell
$ epan create Mojolicious IO::Socket::SSL
[2021/06/12 18:20:04 INFO ] calling cpanm --reinstall --quiet --self-contained --notest --local-lib-contained epan/local --save-dists epan Mojolicious IO::Socket::SSL
Successfully installed Mojolicious-9.19
Successfully installed Net-SSLeay-1.90
Successfully installed Mozilla-CA-20200520
Successfully installed IO-Socket-SSL-2.071

```

This creates a sub-directory `epan` with all stuff inside. If you don't
like this... just change the name with option `-t`!

Well enough for today... if you need something like this, give
[App::EPAN][] a try!
