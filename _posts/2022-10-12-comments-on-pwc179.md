**TL;DR**

> A couple of comments about [Perl Weekly Review #179][pwr179].

So it seems that in the [Perl Weekly Review #179][pwr179] I've been
pulled by the jacket not once, not twice, but *thrice*.

OK, let's clear out a few things:

- *thrice* is a real word, I checked.
- if you don't know what *being pulled by the jacket* means, it's just
  an Italian way of saying that I've been mentioned and somehow forced
  to respond.

So, let's get them in order!

# And

So it seems that I forgot to use *and* instead of the comma for pairing
the last items in the list while writing the ordinal form of the
numbers.

Well, to be fair it does not *seem*. I indeed messed up that.

While looking for some obscure place where I might find some loophole, I
discovered none but learned a few things:

- the [Oxford comma][comma] is called the [serial comma][comma] for a
  reason: it applies to list (series?) of things. It seems that the
  parts of a number while spelling it do not apply, so there is *no*
  comma before that *and*.
- either Google watered down, or my search skill have become blunt.

So well, the change is anyway left as a simple exercise for the
reader...

# Dario's take

I *might* chime in and point out that Dario's solution *might* be about
cardinal numbers and not ordinal ones.

But I'm not a spy and I won't.

On a completely unrelated note, I'd observe that it's easy to find out
[how *first* is translated into Italian][primo].

All in all, I congratulate with Dario for sneaking in!

# James's take

James's take is... impressive. *And* I really hope that the *'s* after
*James* is correct.

Yet, I stand by my octillions. They have a place in this universe, and I
find it slightly offensive to call them names as *trivial*, *nothing*,
*pshaw*, ***and*** *peanuts*. Luck is they have very, very large
shoulders.
