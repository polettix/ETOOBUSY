**TL;DR**

> Moving ahead with [PDF-Collage][].

[PDF-Collage][] is almost ready, complete with documentation and basic
tests.

Before releasing. though, I want to complete the documentation for the
program [pdf-collage][], which is meant as a replacement for
[pdfunnel][]... but still needs a description of the extended file
format.

Stay safe!
