**TL;DR**

> From the past... generative music with no brains!

About 15 years ago I had the pleasure and honor to know [larsen][].

He used [Markov chains][] to generate music automatically, starting from
an *example* MIDI file. Alas, after some time his [Automatic Music with
Perl][] became a bit stale and the pointer to the code was lost...

[Internet Archive][] to the [rescue][]! Here's a copy of the code, for
future generations:

[Local copy][].

Thanks [larsen][] ðŸ˜„
