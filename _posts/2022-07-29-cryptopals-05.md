**TL;DR**

> [Challenge 5][] in [Cryptopals][].

Today's challenge is another of those preparatory work that might seem
like a chore (*or a blessing! More difficult encryption, more
resistance!*) but at the end of the day we already suspect what lies
ahead.

My solution is pretty bare-bones and leaves a lot to be desired:

```perl
sub repeated_xor_encryption ($plaintext, $key) {
   my $plen = length $plaintext;
   my $klen = length $key;
   my $reps = int($plen / $klen) + 1;
   my $megakey = substr($key x $reps, 0, $plen);
   return $plaintext ^. $megakey;
}
```

I first build a `$megakey` by concatenating enough input `$key` copies
so that I can cover the whole `$plaintext`, then apply our [xor][]
friend that we learned a few challenges ago.

This is messy, possibly from multiple points of view. Space-wise it's
inefficient; time-wise, it probably gives out too much information about
the key length.

Probably the best thing to do would be to operate char-by-char, so that
we only use the strictly necessary space and perform a constant
operation for each character, yielding a much more stable time.
Whatever, anyway.

Stay safe *and secure*!
