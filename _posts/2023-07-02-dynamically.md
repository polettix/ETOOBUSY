**TL;DR**

> I discovered about [Syntax::Keyword::Dynamically][].

So it seems that we're about to receive a big gift, i.e. [Perl][] version
5.38 with its shiny new CORE & modern object system.

So I thought of giving *a read* to [Object::Pad][]'s documentation, which
apparently is the precursor of the system. It's been a nice read but of
course it amounted to about 0 because I will not know anything until I try
that out. Anyway, at least I know that there's documentation about *stuff*.

While reading through it, I discovered [Syntax::Keyword::Dynamically][],
which lets us introduce a `dynamically` keyword that is kind of a
super-duper `local`, but including lexicals and lvalues as well. Well, how
cool!

So well, I'm not sure I'm going to use it in the future, because I also
rarely use `local` itself and the SYNOPSIS example is barely applicable in
my case (it assumes lvalues for setting a logging level, and [my favourite
logging module][Log::Log4perl::Tiny] does not support it ðŸ˜…) and I would
probably go for a [Guard][] instead.
