**TL;DR**

> [Minion][] is a handy module.

In a project that I'm on at the moment I'm managing some front-end stuff
that is functional to produce emails with PDF attachments to send to
specific recipients, possibly with scheduling.

In this, having a backend that takes care to do the heavy lifting while
the frontend is busy with the user is very handy. And [Minion][] makes
this possible in a very unobstrusive way.

So, in my setup I'm doing this:

- save an "order" to send an email at a certain (future) time from the
  frontend, saving it inside the database;
- place a task `enqueue_emails` regularly in [Minion][], to get all
  emails that can be sent because they passed their `send_after` date;
- in this job, create a task for each email to be sent, again in
  [Minion][].

I'm using [Mojolicious][] for the frontend-ish stuff anyway (it's the
API backend for the presentation frontend, that will be something in
Javascript probably), so it should not be a problem to schedule a
regular task to enqueue new emails.

It comes with a handy plugin that adds a `/minion` endpoint in a
[Mojolicious][] application, allowing to see how is the queue going.
Interesting, although the fan in my PC started pretty soon because the
page asks for continuos updates (makes sense but still...).

Another advantage is that it can be supported both by a [Postgresql][]
and a [SQLite][] database, which is very handy.

Stay safe!
