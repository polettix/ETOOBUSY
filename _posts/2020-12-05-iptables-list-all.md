**TL;DR**

Sometimes (well, most times ðŸ˜…) I get stuck in understanding how the
networking goes in a machine and I start suspecting that [iptables][] might
be playing some trick.

Now, I know very very little about it, but I know that you can do all sorts
of modifications/redirection/etc. and sometimes it's just right to look into
the whole thing *for something*. Possibly that can be searched with a
regular expression.

The normal printing command is good for a single table, e.g. the default
one (i.e. `filter`):

```shell
sudo iptables -vnL 
```

Alas, this does not print *everything*. And you also have to remember all
the possible *tables*:

```shell
sudo iptables -t nat -vnL
```

Too hassle, enter `iptables-save` instead:

```
$ sudo iptables-save

If a table has a rule, it will print it out. It's what is used for backup,
so it has all the needed info, with the added bonus that the syntax in a
line can be used *directly* to create/recreate rules.

*Super-nifty*!
