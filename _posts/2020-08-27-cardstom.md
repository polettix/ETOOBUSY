**TL;DR**

After a few posts about SVG, cards etc. it's about time to share some
code that allows generating the cards shown in [Some SVG cards][].

You can find it all in [cardstom][]. It's a bad attempt to a pun on the
word *custom* by merging the word *card* in it. You know, *custom
cards*.

You might notice that [I'm using NestedLoops][nl], which probably makes
it clear why I bothered with it so much in this blog about one month ago
(e.g. see post [Algorithm::Loops][]).

The program just scratches the surface. I'm thinking about alternative
ways of describing the automatic generation of cards: right now, it's
generating too many cards, e.g. black version of hearts/diamonds and red
versions of clubs/spades. By the way, this post can become obsolete, so
I'm talking about the [initial import commit][].
