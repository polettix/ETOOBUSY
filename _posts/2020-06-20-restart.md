**TL;DR**

> Time to start blogging again.

There's been a one-week hiatus for very, very sorrow reasons. It's time
to get back on blogging.

I'm finding more and more in the need of something that allows me to
kick-start mini-projects easily, like a generalized minting process. I
did something about it some time ago, but it was a bit complicated and I
can't find all the stuff, so I'm starting over with a new, simplified
design.

Things will be evolving at [skfold][]. I'm halfway in the
implementation, and I already diverged from the design - but in some
minor ways, the spirit is still there (even simpler, after thinking
about it a bit).
