**TL;DR**

> Where I rediscover an old piece of software

Some time ago I found [iGal][], a [Perl][] program to produce galleries
of photos.

Briefly after that, I decided to re-implement it. Mostly for fun and for
exploring the challenges that this would pose. The result was `pgal`,
which was available from my web site... at that time.

I guess these kind of softwares have been overseded by something
different today. Or maybe not. Anyway, I found it useful again to build
my previous post [Some CC0 images][], which gave me the prompt to...

- ... renovate the code a bit (e.g. by using [Path::Tiny][] instead of a
  lot of other modules), and...
- ... package the software as a [Docker][] image based on [Alpine
  Linux][].

So there you have it: [pgal][], the gallery generator!

To use the pre-packaged [Docker][] image:

- ensure you can get images from [GitHub][]'s registry (this, I guess,
  requires you to have an account)
- use the image!

```shell
PGAL='docker.pkg.github.com/polettix/pgal/pgal:latest'
ROOT='/path/to/album/root'
docker run --rm -v "$ROOT:/mnt" "$PGAL" -c -r
```

This will get you started. At this point:

- edit file/files `.captions` to provide a title to the album (or
  sub-albums too), as well as captions for each individual image (you
  can also reorder them and/or exclude some);
- edit `.index_template` (in the album or in a sub-album) to change the
  appearance of the page indexing all photos;
- edit `.page_template` (in the album or in a sub-album) to change the
  appearance of the page dedicated to a single photo;
- re-run the command above to update the generated pages.


I guess this is it!
