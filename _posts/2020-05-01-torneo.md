**TL;DR**

Anyone (ehr, only me I suspect) reading this blog knows that I hammered
their patience with a whole series about [Allocating games in
tournaments][].

I did an example prototype web application to do the management. You can
see it in action, there's a [short video][] about it:

If you're interested, here are some additional details:

- You can try/use it at [torneo][] - please tell me what you think!

- The UI is crude because of my lack of aestethics and
  [JavaScript][]/[Vue][] skills, but it does its job.
  Hints/suggestions/enhancements are welcome!

- The backend is written in [Perl][], with the help of [Mojolicious][]
  and other modules (e.g. for [PostgreSQL][] backend). The backend also
  takes care to serve the single-page [Vue][] application to keep things
  simple. Everything is deployed via [Dokku][].

- The code is available in the [repository][].

Thank everybody that is behind all these amazing technologies. I really
feel like I'm standing on the giants' shoulders.

Happy playing!!!
