**TL;DR**

> [Challenge 15][] in [Cryptopals][].

This challenge gets us back on building some additional tools that will
be useful at a later stage. In this case, it's the missing part that we
didn't code for CBC-mode decryption, i.e. the validation and removal of
the PCKS#7 padding at the end.

Here's the implementation in [Perl][]:

```perl
sub validate_pkcs7_pad ($input, $blen) {
   my $exception = "invalid padding\n";
   my $len = length $input;
   die $exception if $len == 0 || $len % $blen;
   my $lastc = substr $input, -1, 1;
   my $npad = ord($lastc);
   die $exception if $npad == 0 || $npad > $blen;
   my $trail = $lastc x $npad;
   die $exception if substr($input, -$npad, $npad) ne ($lastc x $npad);
   substr $input, 0, $len - $npad;
}
```

I admit on getting it *wrong* in the first place, because I didn't
account for an all-padding block at the end.

The text for the exception is, defensively, always the same and we're
using a variable to make sure of it. You know, with all these oracle
attacks around, we can never be sure of how much info we're giving out
by just providing *different error messages for different error
conditions*.

There are three ways to fail the validation:

- the input's length is 0 or not a multiple of the block size, OR
- the length of the padding is invalid (i.e. 0 or greater than the block
  size), OR
- the padding itself is invalid, i.e. not formed according to the rules.


Stay safe *and secure*!
