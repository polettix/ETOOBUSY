In previous post [AoC 2016/11 - Part 1 solution][] we eventually got past
**part 1** of the puzzle with about 30 seconds of computation:

```
$ cat 11.input
The first floor contains a promethium generator and a promethium-compatible microchip.
The second floor contains a cobalt generator, a curium generator, a ruthenium generator, and a plutonium generator.
The third floor contains a cobalt-compatible microchip, a curium-compatible microchip, a ruthenium-compatible microchip, and a plutonium-compatible microchip.
The fourth floor contains nothing relevant.
poletti@polebian:2016 (posts-11 *)$ time perl 11.pl 11.input
33

real  0m31.129s
user  0m30.636s
sys	  0m0.292s
```

This is not an encouraging time, I know, but it's actually not that bad in
the light of having spent the least amount of *programmer time*. Well...
not any programmer, but *this* programmer.

(I say this because *other* programmers surely spent much less time to get
to a much faster solution!)

So... we have access to **part 2** of the puzzle, which is exactly *the
same problem* but with more stuff to move around:

Well... our code is *theoretically* equipped to tackle this, let's just
craft a different input file, right? Here it is:

```
The first floor contains a promethium generator and a promethium-compatible microchip.
The second floor contains a cobalt generator, a curium generator, a ruthenium generator, and a plutonium generator.
The third floor contains a cobalt-compatible microchip, a curium-compatible microchip, a ruthenium-compatible microchip, and a plutonium-compatible microchip.
The fourth floor contains nothing relevant.
The first floor contains a elerium generator and a elerium-compatible microchip.
The first floor contains a dilithium generator and a dilithium-compatible microchip.
```

Same as before, with two added lines at the end, containing the new stuff.

Everything is in place. We're ready.

*Let's run it.*

*OK it takes more time, that was expected.*

*Is it still running after about 30 minutes?*

*Why is the PC so slowed down?*

*What? This is eating up a lot of memory?!?*

*OK, let's stop it.*

**Back. To. The. Whiteboard.**
