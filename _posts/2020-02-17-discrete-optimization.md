**TL;DR**

The professor is really engaging, it's a real pleasure when you see how much
he's having at teaching that stuff. Really inspiring.

It's a *complete* course, in the sense that you have access to all the
material, including graded quizzes. This is a big plus, compared to many
other courses there.

One drawback of these courses is that you can't *really* discuss your
solutions in depth. While I totally understand why, it's a bummer.
