**TL;DR**

The professor is really engaging, it's a real pleasure when you see how much
fun he's having at teaching that stuff. Really inspiring.

It's a *complete* course: you have access to all the material, including
graded quizzes. This is a big plus, compared to many other courses there.

One drawback is that you can't *really* discuss your solutions in depth.
While I totally understand why, it's a bummer.
