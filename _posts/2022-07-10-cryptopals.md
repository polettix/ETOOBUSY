**TL;DR**

> Learn by doing: [cryptopals][].

The word *crypto* has evolved in the latest years to mean *scams*. This
is a shame.

The origin, you know, is in *cryptography*. [Bruce Schneier][] refers to
it as something aimed at protecting files ([here][]):

> There are two kinds of cryptography in this world: cryptography that
> will stop your kid sister from reading your files, and cryptography
> that will stop major governments from reading your files.

Anyway, the evolution I saw in time is that *blockchain* technologies
are deeply rooted in cryptographic stuff, which gave spur to
*cryptocurrencies*, which gave spur to the wider *cryptothing* that's
mostly a scam. Hence, much like the word *hacker*, it gained a negative
connotation in a wider audience.

Again, this is a shame because cryptographic stuff is interesting and
fascinating, and there's *a lot* to learn without having anything to do
with convincing people to pay you tons of money for a place in a list.

So I've been very pleased to find out about [cryptopals][]. It's no
secret I love *challenges* (I mean, programming challenges), because
they're fun and there's often (always?) something to learn.

[Cryptopals][cryptopals] is no exception:

So, if you're interested into learning something, I recommend it. I'm
currently at the beginning of the third set, and I'm having a lot of fun
and understanding.

Stay... *safe*!
