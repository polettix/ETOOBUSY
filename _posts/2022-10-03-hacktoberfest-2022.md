**TL;DR**

> [Hacktoberfest][] 2022 started...

... and I'm not really thrilled to be honest.

My only option at the moment is [The Weekly Challenge][], so yeah I
should be covered... but I feel like I'm missing the spirit of this
initiative.

There are a couple of projects where I'd like to contribute, one with
code in [Perl][] (medium size) and the other one in C (large). Both seem
to not be interested into [Hacktoberfest][], which is a bummer.

An understandably bummer, right, but still.

Last year I also had a cold shower with [AllAlgorithms/perl][]. My pull
request from 2021 is still there sitting alone.

OK, enough ranting for this year!
