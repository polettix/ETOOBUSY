**TL;DR**

> The *real* [PAUSE workaround][].

After my post [PAUSE workaround][], where I tell a little story of how I
tripped onto [PAUSE][]'s indexer and how I worked that around in a terrible
(although admittedly effective) way, [Joel Berger][] gently pointed me to the
*real* way of addressing that problem:

> I think you can use this
> [https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN::Meta::Spec#no_index](https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN::Meta::Spec#no_index)
> to tell PAUSE to ignore the offending package

And, of course, Joel is 100% right.

The *last mile* (why is there always a last mile?!?) was to figure out how to
set it up in [Dist::Zilla][]/[Milla][]. Luckily, this was easy thanks to
[Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaNoIndex][]:

```
[MetaNoIndex]
package = CPAN::Modulelist
```

So I reverted the change to the module, used the plugin... and it works!

Thanks [Joel Berger][] ðŸ˜„
